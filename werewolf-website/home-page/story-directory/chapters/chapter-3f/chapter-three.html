    <A name='Survivor’s Guilt Trip' ></A>

    The pack is met in the yard at Inspiration Heights by Adele, Eddy, Pearl, Dahlia, Vivian, Constance, and other Garou and kinfolk, some of whom are already waiting at the gate for the prophecied Pack to show up.  Constance makes a bit of a stubborn show of holding the Pack at the gate while she visually checks them and the children over, but relents after a moment when Pearl throws open the gate and bids them enter.  The members of the Sept are in awe of the sight of the missing children and Adele openly weeps at the sight.  Dahlia declares the children healthy.  While the pack is explaining what happened to Constance and Papa Eddy, (Pearl is already up to speed) another garou joins the group.  She-Breaks-Them (Calliope Alessandra) arrives in her motorized wheelchair.  Calliope is the other survivor from the Monroe house attack since months ago, but she was not so lucky as Pearl and suffered many permanent damages from the bombing.   Upon seeing that her child is not among the rescued, as she had hoped, Calliope is furious with disappointment and a tense conversation follows.

      </P>
    <P class='conversation'>
    Calliope:  “Oh, the children have returned, have they?  How can you celebrate?  How can you dance among the graves?  Six months gone, and we have waited for their return, because of the words of the old wolf.” <BR />


    Pearl: “She-Breaks-Them, stop.  The Children have come home.  The prophecies have come true.  Howls has never been wrong-”<BR />


    Calliope: “NEVER is a long time, Pearl.  What of Lillian?  The other little ones?  He promised the children would be safe, and it was LIES.  Lies or failure, and he never answered for it.”<BR />


    Constance and Christopher step forward.<BR />

    Constance: “You’re out of line, She-Breaks-Them.”<BR />


    Calliope: “And will you punish me, Seeks-the-Heart?  Make me run laps?  Use me for target practice?  A word on that: aim small.  My heart isn’t what it used to be.”<BR />


    Pearl: “The prophecies don’t promise anything.  They resolve.  You heard what you wanted to hear, and you took matters into your own hands.  I tried to save you-”<BR />


    Calliope: “What sort of salvation is this?  I am a living mockery!  Broken and hidden, hopeless.  Not even Pegasus hears me anymore.  The Monroe House was a mistake.  YOUR mistake, for trusting him, among other things.”<BR />


    Pearl: “Calli, stop.  Don’t do this.”<BR />


    Calliope: “Do what?  Jason disappears for months on end, Howls-In-Dreams spends all his time IN DREAMS, and we’re left chasing our tails while his prophecies fail and our children die.  We are sitting ducks in an old house with nothing but riddles, while you coddle the newcomers and try to pretend you haven’t lost the wolf.”<BR />


    Chaos.  Constance and Christopher share a quick glance, Dahlia gasps and covers a child’s ears, and Adele quickly gathers the kids and heads back to the house.<BR />


    Eddy seizes Calliope by the throat, his arms swelling, shirt straining.<BR />


    Papa Eddy: “JESUS DULCE, BE STILL, WOMAN!”<BR />


    Constance and Christopher flank Eddy, each grabbing an arm.  Pearl uses her Gift, Serenity, on Eddy, soothing his rage, and he calms down.  A woman passes by, walking a dog, as the scene relaxes.<BR />


    Pearl: “No one challenges you, She-Breaks-Them.  You are credited with saving what little was saved six months ago.  Your sacrifice is undeniable.  But do not believe now that you are beyond reproach.  Living or among the ancestors, you will honor your place, Adren.”<BR />


    A long moment.<BR />


    Calliope: “From deathless dreams the cubs return, in the arms of cubs-no-more.  The broken fury will have justice by truth and consequence.”<BR />


    Howls-In-Dreams’s voice is heard  from outside the group, as he arrives from the house.<BR />


    Howls-In-Dreams: “This is what you get for eavesdropping, sister.  “From a Deathless Dream the Cubs return, in the arms of Cubs-no-more.  Fury breaks before the justice in truth or consequence.  Do you wish to die, She-Breaks-Them?”<BR />


    Calliope: “Yes.  I wish that.”<BR />


    Howls-in-Dreams:  “Under the Litany you have every right to bestill your heart, Fury.  The Sept will support you.  You have but to make the request.”<BR />


      </P>
    <P>
    Calliope casts her eyes downward and says nothing.  The children are taken inside to be fed and cleaned, while Howls-In-Dreams calls a meeting in the Den regarding the children.  The pack is not required to attend.  Constance insists the characters be subjected to a rite of Cleansing before they enter Inspiration Heights.

      </P>
    <P>
    The Underdogs intercept the Pack before the Rite, and Jessie Kinkead speaks to Mira in private, alpha to alpha.  He tells her that he is watching their pack, that he has seen what happens to the creatures the pack kills with tooth and claw, and that he doesn’t know what that phenomena might mean, but he knows he’s never seen or heard of anything like it.  He tells Mira to spill it about their secrets, or he will find them out.  She plays dumb and talks around the issue.

      </P>
    <P>
    Before the Rite of Cleansing takes place, the pack briefly discusses the possible effects of it on their totem.  The pack secretly worries about what such a rite may do to Nil, but it turns out that, Nil-Yen-Obscura is not CORRUPT, and the ritual does little more than cost the pack some of their Gnosis.

      </P>
    <P>
    Pearl speaks to the pack in private, since everyone else is in the Den.  She has decided that the Pack must be assigned the duty of one of the scout packs, to be sent out into neighboring areas in search of a new caern to be founded.  The Sept’s Totem, the Hidden Glade, demands that the Sept continually make efforts to find or found new caerns, and the Sept of the Long Summer has been negligent in their duty since the Monroe house.  The Glade’s power is fading, and Howls-In-Dreams believes that the old totem will abandon the Sept before long.  Time is short.  They have perhaps a month or two.  Pearl explains that other garou have been asking questions about the pack, even going so far as to suggest to Pearl that they are hiding something.  The off-site scout duty would be good cover for Pearl, as it is regarded by some in the sept to be thinly-veiled punishment duty, implying that Pearl is disciplining the pack for some reason, and of course as well it satisfies the Glade’s conditions and will also go toward saving the Sept’s connection to the Dreaming Tree.  Michael makes a bit of a stink about it, and Lexie complains a bit as well, but the bones are cast and this is the way it is.  The pack is excused from duties around the Sept in the meantime, so they may prepare for the journey and get their own lives in order.

      </P>
    <P>
    Three days pass, over which the pack learns a few new Gifts, hones their skills, and are taught new Rites by Sept members.

      </P>
    <P>
    <STRONG>Gross Encounters of the Wyrm Kind-</STRONG><BR />
    <A name='Gross Encounters of the Wyrm Kind' ></A>

    The pack sets out after midnight on the third day of their downtime in order to hunt for Nil-Yen-Obscura.  They follow their totem’s eerie “hunger,” which points to wyrmish energy like a compass pointing North.  It takes them into City Heights and they follow it into a crumbling, decommissioned Elementary School.  The pack tracks the stink of the Wyrm into the girl’s restroom and discover a hole behind a stall, slick with thick slime.  Down they go.  The hole narrows into a ragged, irregular tunnel which eventually gives way into the sewer itself beneath the school.  The pack is confronted in the darkness by several freakish creatures.  The vaguely humanoid monsters have large heads, bulging eyeballs, limp, straggly hair, giant hands on long arms, huge feet, and almost comically stumpy legs.  They each bear a short, sharp tail.  They sort of ape-walk and hop around.  Suddenly the pack finds themselves surrounded by unknown numbers as the Freakfeet squeeze out of the tiny holes in the walls and even pipes, some only as big in diameter as a quarter.  The pack is separated as Mira and Michael engage the enemy deeper into the sewer, while Gabriel, Khonsu, and Lexie fight to protect the flank.  During the melee, Lexie is stung by one of the creature’s tails and she collapses temporarily, firing her pistol point-blank into one assailant, while Gabriel battles two, and Khonsu switches targets furiously between enemies targeting Gabriel and Lexie.  Down the tunnel, Mira charges ahead and closely avoids a trap set by the creatures as they release loose chunks of concrete from the ceiling.  She and Michael set upon the enemy and she destroys two, while Michael’s fury fells three Freakfeet.  The fight ends on both sides of the tunnel.  One creature escapes into the pipes.  A dozen have been killed by the pack.

      </P>
    <P>
    The pack discovers a shrine of filth in a nest made by the Freakfeet, and they learn about the grisly way the monsters reproduce.  Fastened to the walls are several humans, their bodies shaped and pulled impossibly, like taffy, to be spread out in macabre decoration.  One of them is alive.  His belly is huge, distended unnaturally, and something inside him squirms and kicks.  He explains that he was taken from home, dragged through his own toilet and brought here before being . . . impregnated.  He begs the pack to kill him.  Michael obliges, and slays the prenatal Freakfoot inside him as well.

      </P>
    <P>
    Stepping sideways, Michael discovers three evil spirits languishing in the Umbra near the shrine of filth.  He suggests that the pack eliminate them.  Khonsu recognizes the spirits from Michael’s description and infroms the pack they are Wyrm Elementals, called H’rugglings.  They are the corrupt mockeries of Earth Elementals, and they need killing.  The Children of None storm into the Umbra and slay the banes.  After a sniff around for other enemies, the pack is led in a Rite of Cleansing by Michael, and they purify the shrine, purging the dark energies there.  That done,  the pack heads out to finish up their nights in bed.

      </P>
    <P>
    Lexie, Luca, and the Two Furies-<BR />

    The boys all head back to the empty house that Michael and his kinfolk have secured for the pack, and they go to sleep around the house in Lupus form (no blankets can be found in the house yet.)  Mira goes back to Inspiration Heights to go to bed, but is stopped by Calliope, who wishes to speak with her.  She Breaks-Them informs Mira that she is worried about her.  She sees her surrounded by ignorant or unskilled men, remarks on Michael’s argumentative tendencies, and tells Mira that she is concerned for her safety.  “I see you alone and surrounded by enemies, Mira.  You have seen the disarray in this Sept.  Know that I am here for you, sister-to-sister.”

      </P>
    <P>
    Meanwhile, Lexie ducks out to meet with Luca at a nightclub downtown.  They catch up and he expresses great concern about where she has been.  She tells him about her disappearance, and all but informs him outright of the Garou and her involvement in the Sept.  Luca is alarmed but concerned for her.  He says that his business connections may give him inside information about Pitt and the drug trafficking ring.  He says he’ll be in touch about it.  He tells her about the two new street drugs which have been hitting the streets, called Red Queen and the Black Ace.  Rival dealers are in a war over the market for these drugs.  Eventually they depart and Lexie hits the sack back in Mira’s shared room.

      </P>
    <P>
    Knock, Knock-<BR />

    When Lexie awakens, there is a knock at the door.  She overhears Dahlia answering the door, and it is the police.  They ask questions about the whereabouts of Mira Sotomayer, saying they received word that she may have appeared here.  Dahlia denies any knowledge and the detective leaves, saying he will return later.  The boys arrive and the pack talks about this, but Michael gets a phone call from his father, Daniel, in Australia.  Daniel Strands tells his son that he is concerned about the oddity of Jason Yaeger’s activities outside the caern and wants Michael to find out what he can about what the Alpha of the Long Summer may be doing that is so important that it keeps him away from his war-torn Sept.  Michael agrees.

      </P>
    <P>
    Pearl brings them into her chamber to speak privately.  Mira is wanted in connection to the murder of a classmate during her first change.  The Sept is working their connections in the police dept and law to forge a new, fake identity for her, but it will take time.  Pearl tasks Lexie with some hacking for this purpose.  Pearl also tells the pack that they must expedite their scouting trip in light of the new unwanted attention from the police, before handing them a map of the area they are to explore in New Mexico.  One town’s name stands out on  the map:  Truth or Consequences.  Michael gives a rather impassioned speech to Pearl and Mira, and Pearl realizes the ways in which lately she has been failing as acting alpha in executing her authority.  Michael tells Mira: “I do not argue with you to tear you down.  I do it to make you stronger.”

      </P>
    <P>
    Packing, Hacking, Bragging, and Bagging -<BR />

    Outside Pearl’s door, the pack begins to talk about what to do next.  The Children of None all agree that it is more than coincidence that they must go to Truth or Consequences, but first there is much to be done, and not much time.  The pack reconvenes in the Den, where Michael immediately raids the whiskey.  Michael states that while his first priority is to the pack, he is duty-bound to his father’s command, and Lights-the-Way has asked his son to take care of some things here in San Diego.  Besides, Michael has all his paperwork in order and is the only pack member other than Gabriel who is not either an illegal alien or wanted for murder, or currently a missing person.  Plus there is the pack’s new home to sort out as well as the emergency storage unit, and Michael wants to make sure that his cousins are sorting things out properly so that the pack can finally have a home away from the Heights.  The pack asks if they can borrow Zara to purchase a van on their behalf for the trip, and Michael agrees to let her make the purchase on his account.  Michael strides out to take care of his business, agreeing to meet up with the pack in Truth or Consequences once he’s through here.  Mira says to him, “I trust you to do what you need to do here, Michael, but hurry back to us.  I don’t like going into that town without our Ahroun.”

      </P>
    <P>
    Lexi goes about making a large Amazon Prime order (using hacked accounts from some poor rich asshole) and arranges for a great many things to be shipped next-day to Michael’s storage unit, where the pack plans to convene with Zara’s new van to head out to the prophecied town of Truth or Consequences.  Gabriel heads into the kitchen, looking for Papa Eddy in order to perform the Rites of Accomplishment for each pack member.  Mira joins him, looking for Constance in order to petition her for weapons, but they find only a surly Christopher Mercer seated at a laptop in the kitchen.  Eddy and Constance are off-site, but will be back soon. Christopher retreats to another room, seeking solitude.  Khonsu, Gabriel, and Lexi go to the garden to summon and make amends with the tenant spirit in Lexi’s annoyed Spider Bag fetish.  The ritual takes half an hour and they step sideways to speak to the spider, who demands some new stitches, to be kept dry, and to be fed a bird or rodent once a month or so.  Lexi agrees and they all make nice.  Meanwhile, Mira heads to the Library to do some Googling on Truth or Consequences.  Christopher is not pleased with sharing the room, but he puts up with it.

      </P>
    <P>
    Gabriel finally finds Eddy and the pack reconvenes sans Michael so that Gabriel can petition Eddy for their rites of Accomplishment.  The rites done, the pack is recognized for their deeds and Constance returns to the Heights.

      </P>
    <P>
    The Cub Scouts-<BR />

    Mira asks Constance to supply them with some of the Sept’s arms or fetishes while they are on the road.  Constance has anticipated this request, stating that members of the Sept have been jokingly calling the Children of None the “Cub Scouts” and guessing at what they must have done to land survey duty.  Then she takes them into a hidden staircase in the backyard’s Arena, to a room of altars and fetishes.  She supplies the pack with a Bloody Bandages talen for healing and safety, a Stormcloak for protection in the Umbra, and an old standby among the Bone Gnawers called an Australian Switchblade.  For stabbing things.

      </P>
    <P>
    Thus armed, the pack go back to their respective rooms, and Lexi cuts and dyes Mira’s hair to better aid her deception of the authorities.  It’s almost certainly a tender moment.  In the night, Khonsu witnesses an exchange in the backyard between Calliope and an unknown person outside the gate.  He slips inside before he is noticed.  He hopes.  Khonsu tells Mira, and they tell Pearl, who thanks them for their confidence and tells them she will deal with it as she sees fit.

      </P>
    <P>
    The next morning, Gabriel and Lexi head to the storage unit to meet Zara and pack up.  Khonsu and Mira slip out of the Heights through the Umbra to avoid the police.  They pack the van with a ton of camping gear, and off they go on a ten-hour drive.

      </P>
    <P>
    Welcome To Consequences-<BR />

    That evening, before sundown, the foursome arrives in Truth or Consequences just in time to see a low-flying crop-duster plane narrowly miss the Sheriff’s station just in time to miss half the crops it is attempting to dust.  A black-and-white leaves the station in lazy pursuit, and the pack drives under the town’s welcome sign, which has been vandalized and is being scrubbed by a man on a ladder.  The soiled sign’s modified message reads: “Welcome to XXXXX XX Consequences!  A Small Town With A Big Name!”  Pop. 6412.  The pack immediately feels the icy, vacuous hunger of Nil-Yen-Obscura stirring within each of them.  Lexie and Khonsu sense it tugging them to the Northeast, but the yearning of their Wyrmish totem is also omnidirectional to a degree.  “Do you feel that?”  Lexie is the first to speak.  The others agree.  Something is wrong with this town.

      </P>
    <P>
    The Pack stops for dinner at a Mexican place, and after unsettling the young waitress, they move on and cruise past a few churches, all of which are closed, small, or abandoned, except for one.  The pack drives into the parking lot of this huge building: Our Lady Of The Rock Pentecostal Church.  Khonsu senses Wyrm Taint there, a queer sense of supernatural of guilt and shame.  While waiting, the Sheriff and his partner drive into the lot and the pack is accosted by them for a few minutes.  They explain their ghost-hunting cover story to the suspicious cop, who eventually asks them to move on.

    <A name='Rattlesnakes and Rituals' ></A>

    Continuing East, the pack arrives at Elephant Butte Campground, beyond the abandoned remains of the Old Navajo Sanctuary, and they set up camp.  The pack splits up briefly as Khonsu and Mira head out to speak with spirits, trying to discover what happened to the residents of the Old Rez in the 60’s, prompted by Mira’s prior Googling of the city.  Mira and Khonsu manage to find a Wind-spirit, which is unimpressed by their howls, but friendly enough.  It fails to reveal much, if anything, about the area.  Wind-Spirits are fickle.  Meanwhile, Gabriel seeks out wildlife, coming across a less-than friendly rattlesnake.  His efforts to befriend it ultimately result in an hour and a half of hunting a rabbit, which he gives to the taciturn serpent.  It eats the rabbit and seems uninterested afterward.  Khonsu and Mira have since arrived at camp and elected to summon a Fire-Spirit to ask it if it knows about the fire of 1960 that swept through the Old Rez.  The Pack spends a few hours on the Rite of Summoning and, with elbow grease and gasoline, they conjure up a Fire Elemental.  It excitedly tells them of the Old Rez Fire, about how it woke up that night “in a dozen places and worked my way to the middle.”  The spirit then teaches Khonsu the Gift Create Element before departing.  The Pack goes to sleep around 3:30 AM.  In the night, Khonsu’s dreams are invaded by familiar howling.  The voice of Howls-In-Dreams speaks to him.

      </P>
    <P>
    “The shadow of faith damns the father of lies, and though reserved, the ghosts reveal the second secret to save the tree.  The Children of None will black the blight and the Wyrm will unfurl its wings.”

      </P>
    <P>
    History’s Mysteries -<BR />

    The pack awakens and Khonsu relates his dream to them.  They decide the prophetic dream must be pointing them toward the Reservation, since it is likely haunted.  The pack decides to wait to approach the Rez until cover of darkness.  They head back into town to shop for groceries, leaving Lexie in the van with a Wifi signal.  Using her Gifts both natural and supernatural, she researches the town a bit more, and is able to hack the police database and discovers some more information about this town before and during the Fire.

    Truth or Consequences historical facts:<BR />

    1890 - The first bath in the area was built at "John Cross Ranch" over Geronimo Springs 1890. However, the dam was completed in 1916. Elephant Butte Dam was a part of the Rio Grande Project, an early large-scale irrigation effort authorized under the Reclamation Act of 1902

      </P>
    <P>
    1912 - James Flynn Haveron (25 years old) moves to Hot Springs and begins the Elephant Butte Dam as part of the 1902 Reclamation Act’s irrigation project.

      </P>
    <P>
    1937 - Hot Springs becomes the Sierra County Seat.

      </P>
    <P>
    1948 - Our Lady of the Rock Pentecostal Church is founded by Nathan Watterson I, a preacher from Texas.  More and more townspeople join the charismatic preacher’s church.  The Church is so popular, other local churches close down as their congregations flock to the Lady.  The Church is expanded in 1972, and again in 1995.

      </P>
    <P>
    1950 - Hot Springs changes its name to Truth or Consequences, an idea proposed by Watterson to bring tourism to the area and increase its revenue.

      </P>
    <P>
    1952 - Racial tensions, already high between the white population and the Navajo on the nearby reservation, with fights between the two populations increasing in frequency.  The police database has digital copies of the arrests made during this time, showing zero charges against city residents, and more than a dozen cases against citizens of the Reservation.  Among the names of those charged, only one turns up more than once: Stuart Ugly Bear, 25.  This case is also the only one wherein the names of complainants are mentioned in the police reports.  The Pickett Family.   Lexie discovers surviving members of the family living in T or C currently, residing at Picket Mills on the West side of town.

      </P>
    <P>
    1954 - The Peace Between Us Initiative is voted into law by city council, making Truth or Consequences a Sundown Town.  Members of the reservation become legally prohibited from remaining in city limits after dark.  Over the next three years, the reservation’s young people begin disappearing, officially listed as “missing.”  Suicide rates and attempted suicide rates quadruple at the Navajo Sanctuary, and young people begin leaving the Reservation, simply disappearing, never to be seen again.

      </P>
    <P>
    1957 - The Great Dry Spell begins, and over the next three years, New Mexico becomes a tinderbox.  Fire warnings are constant, and laws about brush and farmland maintenance are strictly enforced.  Everywhere except the Navajo Sanctuary, who do not enjoy assistance of any kind from the government and have almost no fire department or tribal police.  Their numbers are less than 500 at this point.

    1960 - Fire at the Old Rez (Then called Navajo Sanctuary) occurs in the second week of May, just after the Fiesta celebration, sweeping across the Rez in minutes, and kills everyone inside, all the wolves in the sanctuary.  Several hundred volunteers from Truth or Consequences rush to the Rez in an attempt to rescue and contain the blaze, but they are too late, and a small group of townspeople from Truth Or Consequences actually perish trying.  Every one of those people belonged to only two families: the affluent Haveron family and the well-known Watterson family.  James Flynn Haveron himself and his two sons, Noah Scott Haveron and Trent James Haveron, as well as their cousins Katherine Grace Blunt, Donald Earl Blunt, Mackenna May Blunt, and family friend, Nicholas Weyman.  The obituaries read that the Haverons are survived by Tabitha Haveron.

      </P>
    <P>
    The Watterson family casualties are fewer, the blaze claiming Nathan Watterson II, and Benjamin Watterson, two of the seven Watterson children, ages 17 and 19, and Nathan Watterson I’s brother, Alfred Watterson.
    The names of all the deceased from both families are engraved on a memorial plaque placed at in the remains of the Old Reservation.  They are all lauded as heroes.
    A federal investigation is immediately launched into the Old Rez Fire, headed by FBI Agents Ike Teller and Eric Tumber.  Tumber dies in an unfortunate accident while surveying treacherous land in the rocky foothills just north of the Rez.  Agent Turner ultimately turns up no evidence of malfeasance, and the fire is officially categorized as an act of God.

    The Pack returns to their campground to wait for nightfall.  Some loud new campers are nearby, drinking.  Three men and two women, one of the latter being pregnant and enjoying a cigarette.
    The men from this group drive their huge truck up to the pack’s camp, almost into it.  No sign of Mom of the Year or her friend.  The muddy truck reads: Lee’s Bait and Tackle.  The driver is Stan Lee, who is unbelievably rude to the pack, especially Khonsu.  His friends are quiet and nervous, but he is drunk, racist, and crude.  He taunts the pack with a local legend about a monster “from the Injuns” called Sam, who is said to abduct young people, in a juvenile attempt to make them nervous about camping here, before peeling off.

    The Pack parks the van on the rugged hills just East of the Rez, and hikes a short way to the fence.  Up and over they go, past a sign reading “Sovereign Navajo Land - NO TRESPASSING.  UNSAFE STRUCTURES.  Fines up to $1,000.”  Once inside, Khonsu tries to Sense Wyrm, but turns up little.  He activates his Eyes of the D’uat Gift to see into the Shadowlands, but it seems to fail him before sweeping across his vision as the spectre of a young Indian woman appears before him, reaching and screaming “HELP ME,” as her skin and hair burn away from her face.  Lexie’s phone beeps with a text message alert before signaling it has lost reception again.  The message is from Michael:  “There’s something wrong with the Dreaming Tree.”

      </P>
    <P>
    Khonsu’s vision is doubted a bit by the pack, given his stress level and his bouts of madness.  Khonsu himself is shaken and uncertain of the truth of what he saw.  Lexie decides to go looking for the ghost of Stuart Ugly Bear, a young Navajo who perished in the fire of 1960.  Stuart’s name was unique in that it was mentioned multiple times in the Truth Or Consequences police records in conjunction with the Pickett family.  The pack considers the mention of ghosts in Khonsu’s prophetic dream, so Lexie performs the Rite of the Questing Stone in an effort to divine his whereabouts.  The makeshift mystic compass points NW, and the Children of None decide to enter the Umbra before proceeding.  Mira attempts to open the gauntlet and fails, and this frustration really sets her Rage off.  Lexie leads the way into the Umbra.

      </P>
    <P>
    The Umbra in the Rez is a hellish landscape of blackened trees, fallen buildings, and drifting ash as thick as snowfall.  The glow of fires in the distance is ever-present, and the reek of smoke fills the air.  The stink of the Wyrm is everywhere, and Khonsu remains on edge as every shadow seems to leap at him from the corners of his eyes.  The pack hears the distressed barking of wolves to the NW, as though they are being chased by something, and Mira’s patience breaks.  She takes off after the sounds, stopping only when the barking subsides momentarily, standing among some rocks and logs.  She turns to the pack, and after a short exchange, one of the “rocks” pulls free from the earth behind her!  It is a 7-foot long eel-like creature with an almost human face, with huge, rolling eyes and a long, sword-like proboscis. Swimming through the air, it spears Mira through the back.  Roaring in fury, she whirls on it with claws as five more of the Misery Fish burst from the ground.  The pack lays waste to the Fish, and Mira takes a moment to reflect on her mistake, driven by the Rage.

    The pack moves on after checking Lexie’s Questing Stone, this time trying to be more stealthy, but Lexie herself stumbles over a rock and slams into the husk of an old, burned-out trailer.  Investigating the ruin, they find that something has been here recently.  Khonsu reluctantly gazes into the Dark Umbra and beholds a young man of American Indian descent, wearing an ornately carved necklace of bone, in a conversation with another young man who looks vaguely Israeli and somehow familiar to Khonsu.  The Indian man looks upset, and the other man is instructing or perhaps informing him of something.  After that, the Israeli one leaves the trailer and the Indian man opens a drawer, removes a revolver, and shoots himself dead.  After Khonsu relates this horror story, the pack moves on, continuing to the NW through the Umbra.

      </P>
    <P>
    Eventually the pack comes upon the tracks of others who have come before them, and these tracks lead directly to the spot where the Children of None themselves had fought the Misery Fish less than an hour earlier!  Gabriel confirms this by finding one of his own broken arrows on the ground.  The pack has come full circle, although they never deviated from their original course.  First stopping to gather their wits, the pack considers everything from Umbral disturbances to curses on the pack themselves.  Lexie checks the enchanted compass and finds it working properly.   They elect eventually to follow the Questing Compass back to the trailer -it is still attuned to finding Stuart Little Bear-  to see if they had missed anything there.

      </P>
    <P>
      Arriving back at the capsized trailer, the Children of None pair off, ladies with ladies and boys with boys.  The ladies sniff around outside the trailer, still in the Umbra, while the boys search the physical world.  In the Umbra, the ladies each detect scents outside the trailer.  Lexie picks up the familiar and unmistakable smell of Luca, her old and dear friend, while Mira tastes the comforting yet odd personal bouquet of Anita Barron, the parental figure/social worker of her checkered youth.  Inside the trailer, Khonsu locates the bone necklace he had previously seen around the ghostly neck of the young Native American man in his vision, before the apparent suicide by gunshot.  It is accompanied by a tiny journal, pages so old and faded that they are illegible.
    Upon opening the journal, Khonsu’s fur stands on end as a cold sigh of air flows past his ear.  Whipping about and activating his Eyes of the D’uat, Remembers-Us gazes into the Shadowland again.

    The young victim from Khonsu’s previous vision stands before him in the trailer, regarding Khonsu from half of a once-handsome face, ruined by the slug that ended his life.  Khonsu engages the shade in a laborious game of charades as the ghost tries to gesticulate what it knows.  The dead man is indeed Stuart Ugly Bear, and Khonsu’s line of questions yields affirmatives for the following:<BR />

    Stuart died here in this trailer on the night of the 1960 Rez Fire, before the fire actually began.
    He is bound to the land or perhaps the trailer, and unable to leave yet.
    Stuart indicated the bone necklace and pointed to the NorthWest outside the trailer.  When Khonsu couldn’t guess his meaning, Stuart held his insubstantial hand over the journal in Khonsu’s massive hand and closed his eye.  In the physical world, the rest of the Children of None, unable to perceive Stuart, beheld the journal opening itself, pages fluttering, until a single word appeared on a page: “Haveron.”  Stuart then placed his hand over his heart and again pointed to the necklace.
    Stuart also pointed to the ground beneath his feet, then drew a finger across his throat in a “kill” gesture.
    When asked about why he shot himself, Stuart made another gesture which Khonsu guessed correctly was about writing on a wall.<BR />

    Khonsu bade goodbye to Stuart: “Rest now, Stuart Ugly Bear.  We will learn the truth of what you seek.  I will remember you.”<BR />

    The pack’s best guess was that Stuart was indicating the grave or resting place of James Haveron, as well as referencing the graffiti they had spied in the distance on the rec center wall here at the Old Rez.  Conversing further, the pack decided to revisit the latest prophecy from Howls-In-Dreams:<BR />


    “The shadow of faith damns the father of lies, and though reserved, the ghosts reveal the second secret to save the tree.  The Children of None will black the blight and the Wyrm will unfurl its wings.”

      </P>
    <P>
    The Children decide that Stuart may have revealed one secret, but that they have not recognized it yet.  They think the second may lie with the Haveron family.
    The pack makes their way the short distance back -in the physical world- to the Rec Center, a burned out concrete-walled building near the site of the fight with the Misery Fish.  The doors are chained shut, and near the entrance is the graffiti that the pack had assumed was referenced by the ghost of Stuart.  It reads:<BR />


    “last night I saw upon the stair<BR />

    A walking man who wasn't there.”

      </P>
    <P>
    Khonsu volunteers to open the locked door by breaking the chain.  As he strains against the rusted steel, Lexie uses her Open Seal gift to pop the lock, nearly causing her packmate to fall over in surprise.  This little prank accomplished, the pack enters the ruined Rec Center.  This place is trashed.  The concrete walls definitely withstood the fires of ‘60, and there's a good deal of furniture and clutter about, but there are no indications of anyone having been here, other than some empty beer bottles and signs of teenage partying.  Khonsu creates a fire in a trash can with his elemental gift, so the pack can see, and they are rewarded with the sad sight of a public building where many died in a fire, or tried to evacuate.

      </P>
      <P>
    There are spray-painted arrows along the walls toward the back of the building. The doorway they indicate is marked “EXIT.” Behind the burnt-out EXIT sign is more graffiti:<BR />

     “He wasn't there again today<BR />

    I wish, I wish, he'd go away”

      </P>
    <P>
    Mira recalls from her Honors English classes that these lines of text are a slightly revised version of a short poem from Antigonish, a very old stage play from 1899 about a haunted house in Nova Scotia.  The pack puts a pin in this trivia for now.

      </P>
    <P>
     Her body in lupus form, Mira noses her way into the door.  Beyond the door is a stairwell going up.  Opposite Mira is a fire exit, padlocked shut.  The pack ascends the stairs, but notices an empty hangman’s noose that someone had hung from the fire sprinkler pipe above them.  Lexie points out that the pipe couldn't support even the weight of a child, so the noose is an intentional -though not functional- gesture of some kind.  As the pack ascends the staircase, they notice more writing on the wall of the landing: “Each night despite my plea and prayer, the man still stands upon my stair.”  Unfortunately, searching the upper floor reveals nothing telling, and the pack departs the way they came in.

       </P>
     <P>
    The Children leave the Rec Center and decide that it is time to go back to the van and leave, to regroup and investigate the Haveron place.  Traveling east, the pack notices of a sudden that they are emerging from some brush into the familiar tableau of the damned trailer of Stuart Ugly Bear!  Mira shouts for a HALT, and the pack freezes.  They check the stars, the compass, and their surroundings.  The compass revolves once of its own accord and then settles in a new direction.  The pack puzzles over this phenomenon.  Khonsu recalls an old story about a compatriot Strider who told him of a Gift the Red Talons used to confuse intruders into their territory.  He thinks this may be the answer to their question, since it appears to be their perspectives that are confused, not the real world.  According to the story, the effect wears off at sunrise.  The pack elects to camp at the lonely trailer.  Mira takes watch.

    In the morning, the pack moves on back to the van.  Just before reaching the border of the Rez, they encounter movement.  Wolves.  The pack goes to ground and Gabriel calls out in the Garou tongue.  The reply is the appearance of more than a dozen Garou in lupus form, appearing from close by.  This is the sept of the Wakeful Eye, led by Adren Ahroun Banebreaker, and they aren’t thrilled with this encounter of foreign garou.  The Red Talon tribe stopped speaking to the Garou nation ten years ago, electing to fight the Wyrm on their own terms, and things have been tense ever since.  After an insult from their angry alpha, Mira faces him down, and his Beta steps in to smooth things over.  Tastes-Rain is the leading Theurge in the sept, and she speaks privately to Khonsu while Mira cools off a little and Gabriel entertains a young Red Talon Galliard.

      </P>
    <P>
    Khonsu explains their reasons for being here, while she listens intently.  She believes him, and is awed by the mention of Howls-In-Dreams by name,  but says there is no way that Banebreaker is going to permit them to leave so easily.  There will be a Cleansing Rite, and then they’ll be examined for corruption.  She asks an alarming question: “What do you carry within you?”

      </P>
    <P>
    Khonsu consults the others and they agree to temporarily break contact with Nil, leaving him with Michael, while the Rite and examination takes place.  Michael agrees, speaking through the totem.  After the Rite, Tastes-Rain says that the caveat is that the Talons will be placing them under the watch of spirit which will routinely report back to the Talons.  The Wakeful Eye is watching them.  She also reveals to Khonsu that she saw them all in a dream recently, which she kept to herself.  “In this dream, it is not clear whether you saved your Caern, but one thing I know I saw: your pack stood amongst a pile of the dead, and those dead were your family.  Everyone you care for.”

    The pack calls Michael to report what has happened, and they speak also to Pearl, who informs them that Enki is coming to join them soon.  Michael relays his experiences at the Sept and says they are coming to Truth or Consequences as soon as possible.  The pack heads to Haveron Hill after stopping at the Diner for another meal.  At the end of the long driveway is a wrought-iron gate, within which is the barely discernible, cleverly hidden design of the Glass Walker glyph.  The pack senses two things when they cross this threshold: One is the unmistakable spiritual energy of what is or once was a bawn, ever so faint.  The other is the cold, relentless hunger of Nil, yearning for the corrupt.  Lexie spots the huge house further down the drive, with three vehicles out front.  One an ancient pickup truck, and two other, newer vehicles: a black sedan and a dark grey van.  The van has writing on its side:  “Grendel Enterprises.”

    <A name="I Knew You'd Come" ></A>

    Michael and Enki are fast approaching along a Moonlit Path (courtesy of a Lune who owes Enki a favor).  While the others talk about how to handle the new developments, Lexie begins tapping away at her laptop’s mobile hotspot to try to crack the mystery about Grendel Enterprises and begins to uncover some interesting ties from the company to a larger parent organization called Endron, and a few references in buried files to a mysterious group called Pentex.  She also learns more about the Haverons, including that Tabitha has a son named Peter Haveron, who lives quietly in Boston, Massachusetts.  Gabriel stands outside the van, bow in hand, scanning the horizon.
    Meanwhile, Mira and Khonsu carefully approach the vast grey house, sticking to the large boulders on either side of the roundabout driveway which encircles a fountain statue of abstract art which Khonsu recognizes as a cleverly hidden glyph meaning “sacred.”  There is a conversation going on at the Patio of the massive house between three suited men on the porch and an elderly woman in the doorway.  The door is adorned with envelopes and notices pinned all over.  Mira and Khonsu dart from their cover to the west side of the house unseen and peer around the corner, crouched by the large greenhouse-style plexiglass windows of the west wing  in order to better overhear the conversation taking place.  Nil-Yen-Obscura links the pack’s five minds so that all can hear, even Michael from his moonlit path through the Aether.

      </P>
    <P>
    The man to whom the elderly lady is speaking is a modestly yet flawlessly coiffed sandy-haired attorney of about 30 years of age with manicured nails.  He carries a small briefcase. His companions are two other suited men, one a balding, bespectacled 40-something with a slight frame but growing belly, and the other a tall and black-haired, goateed 25-year-old with an Abercrombie haircut, and sitting in the sedan is a slope-shouldered muscleman, barely visible through the tinted windows, a Fedora covering his face.

    Elderly Lady: “I told you a hundred times, this is MY place!  You can’t come here and make demands like this.  I OWN this land!”<BR />


    Manicured Man :  “Mrs. Haveron, please be reasonable.  We've talked about this again and again.  Surely you've received our memorandums, the court orders. . .”<BR />


    Elderly Lady (Tabitha Haveron): “I ain't seen nothin that says this house is yours.  You still need a signature, deed or no.  And I'd sooner handshake a bandsaw that put pen to your damn Papers, Smith.”<BR />


    Manicured Man: “My name is Wetzer, Mrs. Haveron-”<BR />

    Tabitha:  “Pretty sure you’re also Smith.”<BR />


    Wetzer: “If we could get past the kid stuff, Mrs. Haveron, here’s the deal:  There is nothing to discuss here.  The hearing is over, you basically forfeited, and your deadline is in one week.  Surely you have seen the notices?”<BR />


    Tabitha:  “All I’m noticing is your perfume, dandy-boy.  When did men start rolling in dead whore before visiting old ladies?  I’m flattered, but you ain’t my type, Smith.”<BR />


    Wetzer: *pulls a wad of notices from tabitha’s door and holds them out*  “You didn’t see ANY of these monthly-then-weekly notices?”<BR />


    Tabitha:  “My eyes ain’t what they used to be, son.  I’m just an old lady looking to mind my own business in my own time, on my own damn land.”<BR />


    Wetzer: “Well this isn’t going to hold up in civil court, I’m afraid.  Legally speaking, you are assumed to have seen and understood these documents.  Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.  These processes don’t have to be difficult, Mrs. Haveron.  They can be easy, and you can make a lot of money.  Grendel has prepared for you a very generous consideration for your relinquishment of the Hill, and we know that everything you have is in this house, and this land.  Think about Peter, or his kids-”<BR />


    Tabitha:  “You keep my grandson’s name OUT of your greasy MOUTH, you dumb cracker!  This land belongs to the Haverons.  End of story.”<BR />


    Wetzer:  “All we want is a clean start here, Tabitha.  You and me both know if you don’t produce that deed, the jig is up in five days.  We contact your next of kin, he comes back and sees the state of this house and yourself, OR he doesn’t come back at all, in which case Dr. Aaronsen here will have to evaluate you.  I think we all know what happens if a psychologist gets too close a look into your head.  Off you go to a nice room in a care facility, Uncle Sam buys this dump at fair market value, and Grendel sets up shop removing that Yellowcake under the ground.  Either way, Peter gets the check, and you get forgotten.”<BR />


    Wetzer steps closer to her.<BR />


    Wetzer:  “Unless you sign the agreement.  Then it’s YOU who gets the money, in addition to the very lucrative stock options in Grendel, as a thank you for the willing and quite noble sacrifice your family makes for the greater good of the nation.  We’ll even put your name on a plaque, right here where this. . . house used to be.  If you think about it, Mrs. Haveron, there really is *no choice* here.”<BR />


    Wetzer holds out the manila folder, waiting.<BR />


    Tabitha pauses, drops her gaze to the folder, and licks her lips.<BR />


    Tabitha:  “I’ve been here all my life, Mr. Wetzer.  It breaks my heart to surrender this house, this land, my history, and my father’s wishes to a company man.  I know you’re just doing your job, son.  And I know how important it is to make sacrifices as an American, especially when it is for the greater good.”<BR />


    *Tabitha reaches for the folder, takes it in her hands.<BR />


    Tabitha:  “And that’s why I am going to use your papers here for kindling, because I have read your little document from Uncle Sam, and even though it says in big scary letters “Eminent Domain” and “Notice of Intent To Purchase,” it also specifies that your priority must be much lower than you’d hoped for in Washington, because those G men  didn’t empower your boss enough to seize this place.  That’s why *you’re* here and that’s why you need my signature or my death, though you’ll see neither, because I see you very well.  I know that you know that *I* know who you are, son.  I know what you represent.  And I will exercise every inch of my power to gain even the smallest bit of wiggle room I can to slip free of its cold, hungry coils.  Now, you quit wasting my time and get your snot-polished haircut the Hell off my porch.  I’m old and this house don’t clean itself, Smith.”<BR />


    Wetzer:  (staring hard-eyed before slipping into easy laughter.)  “I knew it.  You’re a woman of principle, and I respect that.  The world needs principled people.”<BR />


    His smile evaporates.<BR />


    “But my bosses don’t, so now, since you’re so resistant to the goodwill of Grendel Corp, there’s just one more little thing before we call it a day.”<BR />


    Wetzer pulls out a phone, hits the speed dial.<BR />


    Wetzer: “Yeah, hello.  It’s not happening, ma’am.  Yes, I did, ma’am.  No, ma’am, she’s not playing ball.<BR />

    Wetzer:  “Will do, ma’am.”<BR />


    “He stares at Tabitha.<BR />


    It’s just us up here.”<BR />


    Wetzer puts the phone away and, still staring at Tabitha, while all three men produce and put earplugs in from their pockets:<BR />


    Wetzer:  “Vess, come here, please.”<BR />


    The 4th man steps out of the sedan and ambles his huge frame onto the porch and stands next to Wetzer.<BR />


    Wetzer:  “Vess?”<BR />


    Vess: “Yes?”<BR />


    Wetzer:  “Change her mind.”<BR />


    Mira steps from her spot beside the house, palms upturned at her sides as she confidently strides toward the quartet on the porch.<BR />


    Mira: “Excuse me, gentlemen -”<BR />


    Chaos.  Wetzer shouts “THE HELL?” and goes for a firearm in his suit jacket, preparing to fire at Mira.   Aaronsen draws a pistol and levels it at Tabitha, who has wasted no time in turning back and fleeing into the house, slamming the door by it’s golden horseshoe knocker.

    Khonsu, in wolf form, turns and leaps for the greenhouse window, but doesn’t have the weight or strength to break the plexi, and so bounces off and lands back in the dirt.  Enraged, he shifts instantly to Crinos and smashes the glass, scrambling inside.

    Michael fires two shots in rapid succession.  The first takes Aaronsen through the back and he drops his gun and ragdolls to the ground.  The second slug enters the goateed man’s right eye and pulverizes his brains.  Roaring, Mira rises from her quadrupedal sprint and swings a paw like a basket of knives up into Vess, opening him from crotch to throat, nearly tearing him in half, lifting him clear from the earth and into the air.  Nil devours him utterly before he hits the ground.  His shoes and suit fall empty into the dirt.   Taking careful aim, Michael kills Wetzer as well.

    As Lexie pulls up in the van and Gabriel appears from the boulders, Michael walks toward the still-breathing but unconscious Aaronsen, covering him with his pistol.  Tabitha appears in the doorway with an old double-barreled shotgun, fresh blood on her blouse.  She looks at the scene as Mira turns, still towering in Crinos form, to regard her.  Just before Mira reverts to human form, Tabitha drops the gun, their eyes meet, wide and brimming with tears.  A whisper escapes her open lips.  “I knew you’d come.”

Michael and Gabriel search the bodies and the cars, turning up Aaronsen’s briefcase and the usual suspects of wallets, employee ID’s, and the guns.   Lexie enters the house and unceremoniously begins yanking on paintings in an upstairs hallway in defiance of a sign which clearly reads: “Do NOT touch the art!  ~ J.F.

    Over the course of the conversation, Tabitha tells the pack about her father, James, who was Garou, and her brother, and the way that they died in the Rez Fire of 1960.  She claims that they were killed in battle that night.  In the two years before the end, James had begun to act strangely, becoming paranoid and hermetic.  He had hidden the deed to the house somewhere and didn’t even trust his own children with the knowledge, saying that Haveron Hill must never be taken away from the family.  Tabitha says that the land here is special, holy, and that her father knew this, but his illness worsened and he became more and more reclusive with even his favored son.  They both perished in the fire and Tabitha never saw them again.  At 18, she was the heiress to the House, and over time the other occupants left one by one.  With no connections to Garou society, Tabitha did what her father had always told her to:  wait for the wolves to come.  But nobody came, and the years crept past.  Eventually, Grendel discovered the land and took an interest in the Hill, claiming that surveyors had discovered yellowcake uranium ore deposits of such value that they wanted to purchase the land.  She refused.  Grendel appealed to the government and began hounding her.  In order to keep the house, she needs to find that deed.

    Tabitha wears a bone necklace that is the mirror of the one worn by Stuart Ugly Bear’s ghost.  The pack learns that Stuart and Tabitha were secretly in love as youths and were planning to elope the very next day after the fateful night of the fire which claimed her father and brother.  Stuart vanished that night.  The pack relates some of what they learned from his ghost, and Tabitha listens closely.

    The pack interrogates Aaronsen, who is insistent that he “just works for the company” and doesn’t know anything useful to them, but he begs for his life just the same.  Lexie takes his computer and rifles through it, learning about his career at Grendel and also that he is the man who observed and selected certain Grendel “subjects” for reassignment to Canada months ago, with references to their “physical and psychological developments” being the reason for their transfer.   Aaronsen’s connection to Grendel is intimate, he works almost exclusively for the company as a legal consultant and psych doctor for employees within the company.

     Aaronsen’s protected files are psych evaluations for Grendel employees who are mostly miners and/or surveyors attached to projects in various locations.<BR />

     He has extensive notes on their behavior and logs regarding reports to Grendel about them.  Some are labeled ‘STABLE” and others “DC: recommend pass to QC Department.”<BR />

     Aaronsen’s second tier security account at Grendel is accessed and it reveals the entirety of his career with Grendel, from his hand-selection by Acquisitions til now, and  including his responses to corporate regarding subjects “specially suited for rural field work.”

    There is also correspondence which suggests that the house is bugged.  Lexie and Michael set out, searching for the bugs, and finally discover them in the hills around the house, two military-grade solar-powered laser microphones aimed at the house.  They are secured by the wolves.

    The pack reconvenes in the Living Room and Tabitha shows them an old journal belonging to her father.  Scrawled on the last page is the following: In his journal’s preface:<BR />

    The pack discovers that the golden horseshoe on the front door is removable and they split it in half along a hidden seam.  Stamped onto the shoe’s inner seam is the following: R36 L21 R09.  The pack goes upstairs and carefully removes the painting by JF Haveron of his late wife.  Behind it, a safe.  The numbers open it, and within is just another piece of paper, reading:<BR />

    Rearranging the letters in both “gander” and “danger” yields the word “garden.”
    Michael points out that he and Gabriel saw a statue in the garden behind the house among many others, but that this one is of three laborers pounding a giant stake into the earth with hammers.  One of the statues is not working but leaning on his own hammer, watching.  The pack heads to the back, where the garden opens into the beautiful but now dry hot springs of Haveron Hill.  An old statue of James Flynn Haveron stands in the center of the garden, one hand in a suit pocket, the other holding aloft a glass in a solemn toast.  “AQUA VITAE” is stamped onto the base of the statue, and Tabitha relates to the pack that over the last few years the waters at the Hill have stopped flowing, and lately have grown brackish and dark when they do.   “I’d give anything just to see these waters run one last time,” she tells them.

    Enki pulls Khonsu aside and tells him that if he is able to bind a spirit or gain a boon from one, he will have passed his Rank challenge to become Fostern.  Khonsu returns to the group and suggests to the spirit that they all return later to answer the riddle.  The pack returns to the house, and Tabitha, who is feeling unwell, retires for a midday nap.  Khonsu tells the pack about his challenge and Michael sets about crafting an earring from the white gold in the Workshop and a piece of Pyrite found on the grounds by Lexie.  As the hours go by while Michael works, Enki issues his challenges to the other packmates.  Lexi’s challenge to steal something from Enki is met with success as she hacks the Ragabash and shows him, among other things, his Social Security number.  Gabriel spins a tale of sadness and joy, meeting Enki’s expectations as well, and Mira argues both in favor -and against- each tenet of the Litany while Enki badgers her on the finer points.

    Eventually Michael is finished with his earring, a gorgeous work in Escher style, and the pack goes back to Query.  Khonsu talks the spirit into entering the earring, and joining the pack on their journey, with the bargain that the spirit will be the first of its kind to learn the truth about the pack’s Totem, Nil-Yen-Obscura.  Query agrees and Khonsu’s challenge is completed.

    Michael’s challenge, the last among the pack, is to fight each packmate in turn, in the forms they choose.  The pack battles him, starting with Gabriel and ending with Mira.  Michael bests them all but shows his throat to Mira in spite of having the upper hand in the match.  He offers each packmate a lesson about their fights and Enki declares him a success.  Wounds (and perhaps pride) healing, the packmates turn their attention to Query’s riddle, deciding that it refers to an aerial view of the land.  A quick google earth displays a canyon near the town which is shaped like a question mark and bridged by a footpath.  The pack decides that the clue leads here and they prepare for their next steps as the sun begins to set.

    As the moon rises outside, the pack talks over tea in the Living Room with a tired-looking Tabitha Haveron.  Khonsu chooses a second deed name upon reaching Fostern rank: Thoth’s Memory.  The pack tells the story of what has transpired in Truth or Consequences to Michael, and when they get to the eerie writing on the walls of the Rec Center, Tabitha interrupts them.  “You saw the those words on the wall?”  Lexie recites the rhyme, and Tabitha steps out to fetch something.  While she searches the Study, the pack finishes catching Pathfinder up on the goings-on of late, including their encounter with the local Red Talons, the Sept of the Wakeful Eye.  Pathfinder does not talk about any news from the Long Summer, suggesting that the pack call Pearl directly.  Tabitha returns clutching an old book of her father’s which contains in it the rest of a local rhyme about the entity referred to on the Rec Center’s walls.  She reads aloud:

    Tabitha explains that this is a local folkloric tale about an old Navajo spirit known as Walking Sam.  Sam was once powerful medicine and considered a guardian of children and a guide for those who died young to join the Great Spirit, but James Haveron said that Sam had fallen to the Wyrm and become perversely greedy.  Now, Sam is a suicide salesman who convinces the depressed and lonesome to take that final step and end their own lives.
    “Daddy said Walking Sam is as real as you or me,” she explains.  “He’s just impossible to recognize, that’s all.”  Khonsu worryingly points out that his first glimpse of Stuart’s ghost included another man in the vision just before Stuart’s suicide, and Khonsu guesses that the unknown party may have been Walking Sam himself, news which shakes Tabitha after all these years of uncertainty about the disappearance of her ill-fated love in 1960.
    Gabriel hazards a guess that Walking Sam may have been responsible for the fire at the Reservation in 1960, prompting the pack to review the town’s history a bit.  Tabitha mentions once more her father’s deep and abiding hatred for the Pentecostals and in particular Nathan Watterson Sr., against whom he had always been divided on issues in Sierra County.  Tabitha elects to rest for a moment and the pack heads to the back porch for a moment of reflection as they gaze at the moon.  Their fury replenished, the pack gets to work consulting spirits for the gifts they need.  Mira, having not slept since the previous morning (she kept watch at the reservation) goes to sleep in an upstairs bedroom.

    Khonsu and Lexie enter the Umbra in the Garden and Khonsu entreats an Earth Elemental to teach Lexie how to make her fur hard as steel.  The Elemental does so in exchange for her promise to cleanse the earth of Haveron Hill of the corruption beneath it.  During this time, Michael trains with Gabriel in the yard.  Afterward, everyone retires for the night, except for Khonsu and Michael, who summon first a Technology spirit from one of the two broken high-tech laser microphones recovered from the grounds, and then a Metis spirit.  The Tech spirit is friendly to Michael and teaches him Cyber Senses in exchange for a little repair work.  The Metis spirit, however, is incensed at Khonsu, arriving late and refusing to teach him anything.  “What hardship have you endured,” asks the spirit.  “You hide your deformity in shame.”

    <P>
    Khonsu responds by disrobing, displaying the crosshatching of scars his body bears from his many punishments growing up, and offers the spirit a glimpse of his fragile mind.  The spirit is satisfied and shares with Khonsu the morbid gift of Primal Rage.
    Michael and Khonsu bury the bodies in the yard, then Michael feeds and interrogates Dr. Aaronsen in the van before going to sleep himself.  Aaronsen stays in the van.
    In the morning, Khonsu summons a Cockroach spirit to teach Lexie the Hands of Thunder gift, and then an ancestor to teach her Speech of the World, before he teaches her Spirit Speech.
    Mira, Khonsu, Lexi, and Gabriel head to the canyon they saw on Google.
    Michael strips down the truck and sedan of identification, then he ditches the sedan in the sticks and throws Aaronsen into the street outside the Hospital in Truth or Consequences before driving the Grendel truck into the boondocks and abandoning it.  He steps into the Umbra and heads for Haveron Hill on four legs, hoping to meet the pack as they return.
    The others locate the Deed in a box in the dirt and rocks at the base of the canyon, after a short hike, marked by spiritual light in the Umbra.

    Michael arrives at the Hill just before they do, tells Tabitha the good news, and pours them both a celebratory drink.  Just after they toast, the glass slips from her fingers and shatters on the floor.  She collapses into Michael’s arms.  The pack arrives and Khonsu states that she needs medical attention.  They load her into the van, but as they cross the property lines, she reacts by nearly going into cardiac arrest.  Khonsu senses that the land of Haveron Hill has perhaps been sustaining her all these years, and if they take her from it, she may die.  Thinking quickly, Mira has scanned the Deed and calls Peter Haveron in Massachusetts, using her gift of Persuasion to get him on an emergency flight out here.  He agrees.  The pack calls Pearl River to inform her of the latest news.  Pearl impatiently tells them that things at home have worsened, that fomori vagrants have begun assaulting the Caern and the Long Summer has sent calls for aid to neighboring septs, but that until then, there is no help coming until Pearl knows for certain that the Children of None have what they need to clear the way to open a caern in Truth or Consequences.  “You know everything that I do.  Howls-In-Dreams says that it is up to you to fulfill the rest of the prophecy, the second secret to save the Tree.  Until we know it is time, there just aren’t enough claws to go around.”

    This done, the pack worries over Tabitha for a short time, arguing about what to do next, investigate Our Lady of the Rock Pentecostal Church, or contact Stuart Ugly-Bear in the Old Rez in an effort to find Walking Sam.  Khonsu’s mind can’t shake the words of the latest prophecy: . . . the ghost reveals the second secret to save the Tree.  The pack decides that freeing Stuart from his bonds to Walking Sam is priority, and they set out to the Reservation, leaving Query behind to watch Tabitha from the Umbra.

    The Pack drives out to the Rez, leaving the van out front of the South Gate.  Michael shifts to lupus and runs down three desert rabbits to offer to the Talons for ease of passage.  Lexie pops the locks with her Gift and the pack walks in.  Gabriel howls an announcement but can’t seem to wrap his muzzle around the words, embarrassing himself and the pack.  Michael gives it a try and the reply howl is gruff and short:<BR />
     “I am Banebreaker, Adren Ahroun Red Talon and alpha of the Sept of the Wakeful Eye.  Stay where you are.”
    The sept approaches about a dozen strong, with more out of sight in the brush.  The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma wolves approach the Children:  Banebreaker, Tastes-Rain (the Theurge), and Bleeding-Nine-Times (their less-than-handsome Philodox).  Banebreaker beelines for Mira, trying to goad her into provoking him, but she is too savvy to fall for his tricks, knowing that his sept will not respect an alpha who behaves punitively to a wolf who fairly stared him down.  She keeps her cool and after a little lupine throat-clearing from Tastes-Rain, Banebreaker drops the attitude and asks what it is they need.  Mira explains that they are trying to awaken a dormant Caern in the town.  Banebreaker seems incredulous that such a place exists in Truth or Consequences, but hears them out.  Mira and Khonsu express that should they be right, and the Caern opening a success, someone will have to have the honor and duty of serving and protecting it- why not the Talons themselves?  Mira explains that they need to hunt a Wyrm Spirit in the Rez in order to find out their next move, and Banebreaker immediately hands the conversation to Tastes-Rain, blowing off the Children of None.  Tastes-Rain informs the pack that they are welcome to hunt their Wyrmling here, but makes a point of cold-shouldering the pack in front of her sept.  Privately, to Khonsu, she reminds him of her dream about his pack and warns him to be as careful as he can.  Gabriel and Laughs-Like-Coyote enjoy a moment of camaraderie and Michael offers buoyant words to the misfit young Galliard.  With the leave of the Talons, the pack sets off to Stuart’s old trailer.

    At the trailer, the pack enters the Umbra and Khonsu summons Stuart with the bone necklace and journal and his ad hoc ritual.  Stuart arrives and Khonsu uses his Eyes of the D’uat to see him i n the Dark Umbra.  The two engage in their peculiar charades once more on account of the ruin of Stuart’s ghostly face.  Stuart frustratingly tries to communicate to Khonsu a few things, gesturing excitedly.  Consulting the others, Khonsu surmises that he is saying that Walking Sam did indeed convince him to kill himself, and suggests that he must be freed from bondage.  He also asks via the journal about Tabitha, making one word appear on the pages: “Alive?”  Khonsu assures him that she is.  When Khonsu asks how they can free him from Sam, Stuart gets too upset to be clear, so finally makes a word appear on the pages again: “SAM,” and then crosses the name out violently.<BR />

    The message is clear, and Stuart’s connection is fading, but how do they find Walking Sam?  Stuart mimes writing in the air, and comprehension dawns on Khonsu’s scarred face.<BR />

    Khonsu’s ad hoc Rite of Summoning is not an easy one, and Sam proves to be a difficult spirit to summon.  After more than an hour of chanting the rhyme, Khonsu stops, and the pack looks around dejectedly for a few long moments.  Suddenly a familiar howl breaks the silence in the Umbral air outside the trailer.  Enki-the-Shadowless has returned.<BR />

    The pack follows Michael outside the trailer, his hackles bristled suspiciously.  Enki stands some yards away in his earth-toned traveling clothes and dirty New Balances, his easy grin hanging off his face.  He speaks in his familiar mess of a Middle Eastern accent: “I am back with news from home!  Did you miss me?”
    Michael’s muzzle flares wide as he sniffs the air, detecting nothing.  His eyes travel down to the dirt and ash at Enki’s feet.  No tracks in the ashes, as though Enki had fallen out of the sky and landed there.  Roaring, Michael rushes the distance, talons flashing, and opens the figure from shoulder to hip.  The pack pours in to engage.  Mira and Gabriel rush at the spirit just as the brightly glowing, gossamer owl-feather webs of Khonsu’s Spirit Snare burst all over the thing as well.  Just as quickly as he appeared, Walking Sam dissolves.
    “Where is he?”  Mira growls her frustration.<BR />

    “Re-Forming in his home realm,” Michael is already on the move.  “Come on, we can’t lose him now.”
    The pack runs through the Umbra, spotting signs of the way to Sam’s realm: spiritual blood splatters, empty prescription bottles, a bloody razor.  Samples of suicides.  After half an hour of running, they find themselves in a woodsy park, with trails and pathways leading in many directions through the trees.  It is getting dark here in this place, and the treeline is thick and shadowy. Each path leads to a clearing with a different suicide scenario playing out in it.  The souls trapped in these scenes relive their last moments endlessly, playing out their own deaths on a loop again and again.  The pack follows Sam’s trail through a house in a cul-de-sac, pausing to watch a young woman dressed in 1940’s clothes open a letter in her mailbox.  She reads it, then drops it to the ground as tears run down her face.  She enters the house, followed by Michael.  Lexie examines the letter with the others.  It is a nonspecific letter from UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, reading an utterly generic message informing the wife of her husband’s death overseas.  In the house, Michael watches the woman open her veins standing over the sink.  He speaks to her, but she ignores him utterly.  Before she sinks to her knees, his claws release her from her torment forever.
    <BR />


    The pack runs through more woods, and, seeing Stuart Ugly-Bear pointing the way, they reach a small clearing with a single old campground trail lamp casting a sickly pallor over the foot of a wooden and dirt staircase leading way, way up.  Night has fully fallen here.  The pack goes up, Michael leading.  The darkness and mist completely black out their vision as they ascend.  Michael changes his vision to echo location.  From nowhere, the pack hears voices, each of them being addressed without the others hearing.<BR />

    Michael hears Mira’s voice:  “Pathfinder, I can’t believe the mess we’re in, now.  You really need to think before you lead us off into such a dangerous place.  Look at how vulnerable we are!  You are letting us all down.”
    With ice in his voice, Michael replies: “yes, my Alpha.”<BR />

    Gabriel hears Mira’s voice as well: “Gabriel, I am not impressed with you.  You can’t even muster a greeting howl.  You weren’t a part of this pack in the beginning, and you’re replaceable now.  Don’t forget it.”<BR />

    Lexie hears Khonsu’s voice: “The others won't say anything, but they're all tired of carrying your weight.  The spirits don't even want to talk to us because of the shame of your burden.”<BR />

    Khonsu hears Enki’s voice in his mind: “Your broken mind is a danger to yourself and the pack.  You are failing them as Theurge and yourself as Garou.”<BR />

    Mira hears Michael’s words in her thoughts: “Your judgment has always led us from bad to worse.  There is no more room for it.  My challenge still stands.  Remember that.”<BR />

    Reaching the top, they see Walking Sam standing in a room of nothingness, and each packmate beholds a different person:<BR />

    To Michael: Michael’s father<BR />

    To Mira: Her old Social worker, Anita<BR />

    To Lexie: Luca<BR />

    Roaring, Gabriel bursts past the others, tearing into Sam, joined by Michael and Mira.  Sam screams, changing into the true form of Walking Sam, as three spirits materialize around him.  He appears as a seven-foot tall suited man in a hat, with no face at all.  The spirits appear to be veiled women in mourning dress, and one by one they shriek in grief and fury, unleashing blasts of supercooled air into the wolves.  Mira tears Sam’s legs from under him as Michael and Gabriel savage him to pieces.  Nil devours him.  Lexie bears the brunt of the Grievers’ blasts, and her Steel Fur only just protects her.  She exhales a steamy cloud of breath before falling to the black ground and losing consciousness, reverting to Homid form.  She is blue from head to toe.  As the pack takes care of the Grievers, Khonsu lays his paws on her and heals most of her wounds.  She will bear an ugly scar for the rest of her life.  Upon the death of Sam, the untethered Umbral realm begins to collapse in on itself.  The pack flees, Michael shifting to Hispo and scooping up the ghost of Stuart.  They exit the realm as it disappears and end up in the Penumbra on the Reservation, not far from Stuart’s trailer.   Stuart remains in the umbra this time, no longer tethered to the Dark Umbra or to Walking Sam’s forest of suicides.  Wasting no time, Khonsu speaks to Stuart, offering to bind him to himself for the time being, saying that they will take him to Tabitha, but first, they must investigate Our Lady of the Rock.

The plan is to split up, one packmate staying in the physical world to be less disturbing and obvious than a whole pack of angry garou in a crowd, and the others will examine the spirit world for clues.  Michael volunteers to go alone.  Leaving his gun and scarf, he disappears into the throng of congregants and enters the bathroom to freshen up.

    The others step sideways in the van, and Khonsu uses his gift of Sense Wyrm.  Somehow only the faintest traces of corruption are present outside the church.  In the Umbra, the church parking lot is empty, the grass overgrown.  There, the church looks somehow even cleaner than in the physical world.  Faint hymnal choruses can be heard emanating from within.  The pack walks in the front doors past the overgrown lawn, and into the congregation hall, and here our story divides into two perspectives:<BR />

    Physical World:  After freshening up a bit, Michael leaves the bathroom and walks the length of the crowded hall.  There is a gigantic cross of some polished white material on the wall behind the stage, with a gray-striped white stone about the size of a fist embedded in the center.  The congregants are so numerous that they are having trouble getting seated quickly.

    <P>

    Umbra:  The Church is immaculately clean on the inside, and full of the shadowy shades of the living human congregants packing the place several hundred deep. The sounds of joyous singing and prayers appear to be emanating from the very walls and arches themselves.  The cross above the stage here is not gleaming plastic or painted metal.  It is sharp, bleach-white bone.  The stone that is the church’s namesake rests placidly at its intersection, just as in the physical world.

      </P>
    <P>

    Physical World:  The church is packed and roughly ten volunteers wearing silver pins of the Lady of the Rock symbol, a stone behind a cross, are assisting congregants to their seats and smiling and greeting.  Michael finds a seat near the back of the massive room and settles in, his senses primed.  Eventually, a sandy-haired, gold ringed, conservatively suited 30-something enters from the back.  This is Pastor Nathan Watterson III, and he strides confidently to takes his place at the Podium, his dark eyes regarding the crowd.  Watterson opens his mouth to speak.

    Umbra: The place seems immaculate and in order, but Nil is starved with aching hunger for the corruption it senses.<BR />


    Gabriel asks the pack’s totem, “where is the corruption, Nil?”<BR />


    Nil-Yen-Obscura’s startling un-voice replies in typical spare fashion: “All around us.”<BR />


    The church is full of shades of people, and to Khonsu, the air here smells like fresh paint over a violent crime scene.   Nathan Watterson is not present in the Umbra.

    Nathan Watterson III: “If you’d like to rise this afternoon, today’s sermon is the Sermon of the Mount and the Parable of the Weeds.  The 5th chapter in the Book of Matthew is the Sermon on the mount.
    ‘The liberals love the sermon on the mount.  You’ll never hear a liberal preach what I’m about to preach to you on the sermon on the mount.  That said, the parable of the weeds is about you, each of you, especially those who are not who they say they are . . . in the eyes of our Lord God.
    Father, add your blessing to this word and give me unction to preach this now in jesus name, Amen.  You may be seated.”

    <P>

    Physical World: Everyone sits.  Nathan appears to gather himself up before raising his hands high and clapping.  When he does, the room falls preternaturally silent.  Michael can sense the power coming from the stage, feel it sapping his will to interrupt or leave.  He, like the others, is spellbound, but not submissive.  He recalls a Gift about which he's heard that is used by Garou leaders to demand audience, and this feels like that gift sounds.

      </P>
    <P>


    Umbra:  Upon the beginning of the verse, the already gloomy Umbra becomes darker, the air hotter, hard to breathe, and from around crevices in the arches above come at first a trickle of Kalus Banes, no more than four or five, watching the congregants, who are unrecognizably ghostly shades of themselves in this church.  These minor banes appear as featherless birds about the size of large parrots, who sport soft beaks of skin and sly, watchful eyes.  They do not appear to notice the pack at all.

    Nathan Watterson III:  “From Matthew Chapter 5, Verse 17: Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.  For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother out of control shall be in danger of the judgment, and whosoever shall insult his brother shall be in danger of the council, but whosoever shall say, Thou fool to his brother shall be in danger of HELLFIRE.’”

    “Now, the last word in this passage is not Hell, but HELLFIRE.  Jesus talked a great deal about Hell, and in great detail.  If you don’t wish to believe in Hell, that does not make it not so, the BIBLE is not here to prove anything.  You can choose to believe it or not.”

    Umbra: A great yawning and ragged hole opens in the air above the Podium, blurring and distorting light and sound around it.  It stops at about 4’ X 4’ and holds steady, like a mirage you can touch.  The voice of Pastor Nathan Watterson III pours out of it, resounding off the walls and pews in the Umbral church.  Khonsu’s brow furrows, Mira’s eyes narrow, Gabriel nocks an arrow to his bow, and Lexie’s eyes dart right and left, cataloging.
    “I think I can reach the stone,” Mira says.<BR />

    “It’s got to be 18 feet straight up, though.”  Lexie is not convinced.

      </P>
    <P>

    Nathan Watteron III:  “Most churches these days don’t talk about Hellfire, it’s not popular, it doesn’t make folks feel good, but that does not change the facts, and the Son of Man preached about Hell more than anyone else.  HELL EXISTS.  That is not a BAPTIST doctrine, nor a Christian doctrine, it is a FACT.  There is nothing you can do about it.  Hell is a PLACE, it is SOMEWHERE and it awaits you if you do not live in Christ.

      </P>
    <P>

    What have you done today to prepare your soul for eternity?  Where will you go when you die and you WILL die, oh, yes you will, make no mistake in that.  Your body is a foul vessel unworthy of heaven, it is not permitted, corrupted, TAINTED, STAINED, and it will not last.  You may die fifty years from now, next month, tomorrow, TONIGHT, but your body *will* die.  Your breath will still, your heart will slow and stop, and your eyes will cloud unseeing, and there will be NO LIFE left in you.”

    Umbra:  The Kalus Banes are mobile now, and they are birthed from the shadows of the arches at a faster rate.  From five, there is eight, no, ten.  Now thirteen.  They are swooping down onto the shades, settling on their indistinct shoulders, squawking dark urges into their ears.

      </P>
    <P>

    Nathan Watterson III: “I know you have prepared your whole life but you have planned nothing whatsoever for the afterlife.  Someone died today and they went to HELL and what a surprise it must be to lift up your eyes in HELL.  It is as if you would awaken far from where you were, in a place beyond your reckoning, and your will won’t belong to you- does not belong to you- your thoughts are not your own, you are the Devil’s playthings now, can I get an Amen -”

    Umbra: Kalus Banes are now everywhere in the Church, flitting from person to person, sometimes stopping to whisper to each other above the crowd or to point out a particular human to one another before diving back down to continue their perverse mission.<BR />

    Mira’s expression says screw this,  before rushing off the stage and into the swarm, snarling.
    “Mira, wait!  You’re just going in there?”  Khonsu asks in disbelief.
    “We’re Garou, aren’t we?”  Mira bounds over the pews, swiping at the creatures.  “Combat the Wyrm wherever it dwells and breeds!”

    Gabriel moves to cover Mira from the side, just offstage, with his bow.
    Lexie pulls her gun from the Spider bag and channels her gnosis into an endless bullet supply.  The pistol vibrates with energy like a Jack Russell in a rat lab.
    Khonsu raises his huge paws in a gesture to the elements within him.

    Physical world:     A low chattering underscores the Pastor.  Michael tamps down his instinctive desire to leap sideways and join the battle with his pack and instead discreetly looks around him.  People are more animated now, standing and reaching skyward, some point fingers in the air.

    Umbra:  The Kalus banes are now swarming in panic as Mira’s claws and fangs find them,  grown fat and faster, chirping and whistling as they go.  Gabriel looses three arrows, first winging, missing and then skewering Kalus banes.  Lexie’s pistol spits thunder and the slugs rip through the dirty birds one by one.  Khonsu’s focus causes the pews in the front row to erupt into flames, driving back the creatures.  The hole above the Podium begins to hum sickeningly, vibrating the bones of the four Children of None in the Umbra.  Horrific humanoids appear in the Church now from the shadows on the walls, wading into the sea of congregants.  Their black eyes peer coldly from the masks of grotesque delight and fury that are their faces, embracing some of them strangely, snapping and snarling at the Kalus Banes as well.  They, too, do not seem to notice the pack yet.
    Khonsu shouts “Mira!  We have a problem!”<BR />

    In thoughts, he conveys to the pack the nature of the new banes.  These are Scrags, the literal spiritual embodiments of murder.  They live only for the moment that life is extinguished against its will.
    There are over a dozen of them among the throng of Kalus.

    Nathan Watterson III:  “For the Bible said in Hebrews Chapter 12 Verse 29 - Our God is a consuming fire, there’s holiness about God, if you could go in God’s presence unsaved then I would literally annihilate you, ye serpents, ye dogs, ye who would walk as wolves among men, be warned!  The slaves of the garden may not know you, but GOD’S EYES can see you, yes, and I can smell your stink in my house, and ye will not stand in the garden, no, ye will kneel in the PIT, ye will BURN in the LAKE, ye will DANCE THE DEVIL’S SPIRAL until your life ends, your soul breaks, AND ALL THAT YOU LOVE WILL BE SWEPT AWAY.”

    Physical world:  The congregation erupts into fervent cries of passion and fear.  A woman falls to the floor, babbling in unknown tongues. Volunteers quickly penetrate the crowd to elevate her and carry her off.  Everyone makes way.  The sobbing and laughter mingles into one unified hysterical voice, carried on the stiflingly muggy air, multiplied by the hard angles of the church and then muddied into white noise by the soft bodies of the frenetic organism that was the congregation as it congeals into a tide of dangerous emotions.  At once, some nearby congregants seem to notice Michael’s presence among them, looking over their shoulders, scanning the room, settling their eyes on him.  Hostility is evident.  Michael can feel the hair stand up on his neck, but his steely stare turns their eyes away, except for one young man who meets his glare with a curled lip and stained teeth.  Pathfinder doesn’t move, doesn’t even blink.

    Umbra: As the blaze on the pews spreads, Gabriel struggles against a group of Kalus banes, taking advantage of his isolated position.  Mostly the birds are ineffective and he swats them off, but one manages to rake its talons across his shoulders, lightly slashing him.  It caws in delight just before he destroys it forever, but the poisonous corruption is upon him anyway.  Gabriel immediately becomes filled with flippant derision and impatience.   Hearing Khonsu, the others all run for the exit to the back of the church on the right, except Gabriel, who stands where he is, scowling and nocking another arrow.<BR />

    Mira sees this and sends the pack a thought: Gabriel!  What are you doing?  We’re falling back, NOW.
    Gabriel’s response is terse and inflammatory: Why should I run?  I’m not afraid of them.
    Incensed, Mira replies: MOVE, Gabriel.  Never question me again.<BR />

    Distracted, Mira bounds onto the stage and into the haze in the center.  The pain is indescribable.  In an instant, she is brought to her knees by malevolent energies that seek to tear her apart, and only her inertia carries her clear of the danger.  Gasping, she regains her paws and heads for the door.  Gabriel follows petulantly.  Lexie pops the lock with her gift and they escape into the parking lot, returning to the physical world.

    Physical World:  The pastor has wrapped his sermon up with common placatory prayer, and the crowd has calmed some, but still twitches with violent energy as they get up to leave.  Michael stands to exit, but not before pickpocketing the aggressive young man who stared at him.  The wallet is a piece of shit.  In the parking lot, he glances at the license.  Dan Lee, resident of Truth or Consequences.  They all climb into the van and drive off, headed for Haveron Hill.

    The ride is instantly tense.  Khonsu is visibly rattled, sitting shotgun.  Michael drives, his expression cold and serious.  Gabriel sits with his arms crossed, frowning at Mira.  Lexie watches everyone.  Michael catches Mira’s eye in the rearview.<BR />

    “Mira, what you said back there is not acceptable.”<BR />

    Mira’s eyes widen and she says “What are you talking about?”<BR />

    “You don’t get absolute power over Gabriel.  You talked to him like you do.”<BR />

    Mira’s voice rises. “He disobeyed my orders!  We were in BATTLE, Michael!”<BR />

    “I don’t care, Mira.  You can’t speak to him like that.”<BR />

    Roaring, she fires back “I AM HIS ALPHA.”<BR />

    As the exchange heats up, Khonsu begins to panic, seeing visions of Michael and Mira in wolf form, tearing each other to pieces in the cramped van.  Lexie moves closer to comfort him.

    Losing patience, Mira shouts “MICHAEL IS MANIPULATING YOU, KHONSU!”
    Khonsu grabs for the steering wheel.  Michael shifts to glabro and stiff-arms him back into his seat, slamming the brakes and pulling the van over.

    <P class='conversation'>

    Gabriel scoffs, and says “Wah wah wah, there’s always something wrong,” gesturing at Khonsu’s thrashing arms.  Michael pulls his knife and throws it past Gabriel’s face.  It damages the interior wall of the van, making a tiny hole to the outside before falling to the floor.  “Shut up, Gabriel.”<BR />

    Lexie reaches over and slaps Gabriel in the face.  He reaches out and touches her, using his Falling Touch gift to send her sprawling.  Khonsu regains his wits and leaves the van without a word.  Gabriel unbuckles and follows him.  Red-faced and pissed, Lexie runs out after them.<BR />

    Mira shouts at them to come back.  Michael says, “Mira, let them go.”<BR />

    Whirling, she spits “we are on a mission, Michael.  Do you want Tabitha to die?”  The Glass Walker’s face is frozen and silent.  Mira shuts the door and they drive on as the others run to the Hill on four legs.  The fresh hole in the van’s wall shrieks all the way.

    At the Hill, Peter calls Mira with some questions about what, exactly, is wrong with mom and who she is working for.  She dodges his questions and insists that he arrive soon.  He says he’ll be there tonight, but he must know who she is and what she is doing there.  Again, Mira balks.
    “I’m calling the police,” he says before hanging up.  Michael calls him back with a fabrication about them being nursing staff.  Peter is mollified for now.  After the call, Michael turns to Lexie.
    “I need you to forge medical certifications, documents, and a nursing license.”

    Feeling the need to be alone, Khonsu heads out into the backyard in the early afternoon sun to meditate beneath the tree in which Michael and Lexie battled for his rank challenge.  He closes his eyes and meditates until the deep lines in his brow finally soften.  During this time, Michael inspects the front porch for signs of the struggle with the men from Grendel Corp, cleaning up some bloody marks and picking up spent shell casings, as well as spackling a bullet hole while listening to a police scanner.  You never know.  Lexie occupies herself with the forging of the documents Michael asked her for, which turn out to be some of her finest forgeries.  Luca texts her and she says she will get back to him later that night.  “I’m up late,” he tells her.
      After Khonsu is finished meditating, Mira speaks to him privately, chagrined with the dust-up that occurred in the van.<BR />
</P>
      <P class='conversation'>
    “Khonsu, I’m not proud of how things played out back there.  I don’t know what came over all of us, but as Alpha, it is my responsibility to hold us together in hard times.  I owe you an apology.”
    The Silent Strider’s face betrays surprise for only a moment before he says, simply, “Mira, I understand what it means to lose control.  All is forgiven.”<BR />
</P>
<P>
    Mira suggests that the dark influence of Our Lady of the Rock may have been partially responsible for their descent into infighting, and asks Khonsu to perform a Rite of Cleansing.  He agrees, but suggests that Michael perform the Rite, since he knows it.  The pack assembles in the yard and the rite is performed.  During the mystic rite, Mira gasps.  Something that had been nagging at her since the Church resolves itself in her mind.  She recognizes the stone from that Cross!    She runs upstairs and brings down an old photograph from the bedroom depicting a young Tabitha and her father unearthing the gray stone from this very property.<BR />

    This revelation spurs a conversation about the how the stone came to be in the church and whether or not the church is truly what it appears to be.  The pack decides that what they are looking at is the pathstone for the old Caern and they call Pearl to relay the info to her.

    Pearl listens intently and then tells them that they are to do whatever it takes to retrieve the stone and cleanse the Hill to prepare for the Rite of Caern Building.

    Mira and Gabriel return to the Rez to petition the Red Talons for help.  Once again, they offer some killed rabbits (courtesy of Gabriel) and then Mira does nearly all the talking, convincing the Talons to help them with the raid on the Church, promising a glorious battle and the newly founded caern once this is over.  Banebreaker promises two packs, who will meet the Children of None at the Church that night.  They explain (almost) about Nil, saying it can’t be shared with the Talons.  Banebreaker lets it go.<BR />

    During this time, Michael and Khonsu speak to Peter at the Hill, who has a *very* hard time accepting the bluntly-put truths they are explaining to him about his family, Tabitha, and Haveron Hill.  Frustrated, Michael shifts to Glabro in front of him, and he passes out.   The Children reconvene at the Hill and prepare for the raid that night.

       The pack heads out that night to the Church, the pack coming in through the front door -except Khonsu, who is in the physical world, readying to support Tastes-Rain’s pack in the Umbra.  The other Talons are in the back of the church, murdering security guards.  Entering the church, the pack hears a commotion in the back just as Gabriel tears down the stone from the cross.  Banebreaker’s pack has run into trouble.  The orchestral pit rises from the darkness, bearing a troupe of hideous monsters who immediately assault the wolves.  Khonsu leaps through the window to assist his mates, as Tastes-Rain and her pack is hung up in the Umbra.<BR />

    The monsters are a mixed group of freaks and in the fight Lexie is grievously wounded by a giant, but heals just fine.  Mira is bitten by a Black Spiral Dancer, but rescued by Khonsu’s Mother’s Touch, Gabriel is paralyzed with mind-blasting by one of the white-robed children, as is Khonsu, just after setting a Spiral Dancer ablaze with his gift.  During the battle two of the white-robed Fomori spit strands of sticky, powerful webbing at the Garou, making life difficult, while armored, thorn-skinned ones charge the pack.  The Children of None are holding their own against the monsters, but the fight is tense and the odds are not favorable.  Michael empties Tabitha’s old Double Barrel at two holy terrors -revolting, eyeless monsters with no legs, practically all mouth, teeth, and tongues.  Gabriel and engage two Black Spiral Dancers.  Lexie faces the Giant alone.  Khonsu next falls prey to the young boy in the white robe’s psychic assault, pain blossoming through his body, driving him to one knee.
    Tastes-Rain and her pack arrive from their hang-up in the Umbra and engage the creatures, the Red Talon Theurge herself perceiving Khonsu’s plight instantly, leaping across the battle to assault the boy, seizing him in her great jaws and shaking him to death.  Growling, Khonsu regains his feet.  Michael and Sad-Songs each dispatch another Holy Terror, Michael tearing his foe apart as Sad-Songs thrusts an arm down the throat of the other, tearing its great horned tongue free.   Lexie battles the Giant, who wields a massive iron and stone cross, overwhelming her in a moment of misfortune, but is rescued by Gabriel, who finishes the wounded giant.
    Meanwhile, Banebreaker and his wolves are embattled loudly in the back room behind the stage.

    When the fight is over, Gabriel pulls a talen dart from his face.  The wound does not heal.  Lexie does a little twist to loosen up her freshly healed spine.  Banebreaker and his pack are gone from the back room, and so are their enemies.  Blood splatters and broken furniture, including a tortured refrigerator, are all that is left.  Tastes-Rain tells the Children of None that her alpha does not need help tracking the remaining enemies, so she and her packmates leave the church, their duties fulfilled.

    Lexie and Michael investigate the downstairs and backstage areas and find a series of fetid, Wyrm-stinking living quarters and pens undoubtedly for the creatures they just fought, behind a locked door.  The cleanup of this crime scene is not an easy one, so the Children begin working, piling bodies and things into the van and the security car.  Lexie damages the fire sprinkler system innocuously, and then she and Michael set what should look like an electrical fire.  The pack heads out to the Hill to take care of the rest as Our Lady of the Rock turns to ash.  Michael calls Zara, his kin, back home and instructs her to go to Inspiration Heights for the night.  Khonsu took Stuart’s ghost to Tabitha and then Peter awoke and spoke to Khonsu.  “You’re the last ones she spoke to, and I want you to know that I’m ready to do what Mom wanted.”   Stuart laments over Tabitha’s sleeping form for a long time as the pack shakes down their fur.

    Pearl calls back, telling the pack that the caern is now under constant and intensifying assault, referencing the wasp banes that Michael encountered on his caern duty.  “Michael, those banes were infecting our spirit alarms, turning them against us.  It was only due to the dreamcatcher fetishes Aunt Maybe put up as backup that we were able to discern the differences.  We’ve been discovered.  You must do whatever it takes to clear that land, and when you do, now that you have the pathstone and help is on the way to us, you can signal us to come to you so that the cleansing and the Rite of Caern building can begin, but not before that land is cleared.”

    After this disheartening talk, the pack is discussing what they should do to accomplish this when Khonsu feels the cold breath of the ghost on his shoulder.  Stuart insists that Khonsu follow him, taking the pack off the property and North, around the mountainside to the old Jade Bluffs Mine Road.  Stuart’s meaning is clear: whatever they are looking for is in that mine.  Michael is adamant that they go inside.<BR />

    A howl breaks the talking, as Bleeding-Nine-Times, Alpha Philodox and a companion from the Red Talons approach.  He expresses to the pack his suspicion with the overall motives of human-born garou, and his concern that, after this situation is resolved, the ‘monkeys’ will continue to interfere in his tribe’s personal war against the Wyrm.
    The scarred and serious old wolf tells them, “do not take actions against our people and the way we fight for Gaia.  I know you are telling the truth, but I do not trust the story of you.”

      </P>
    <P>

    The old Half-Moon tells the pack that the Talons have their own watching Haveron Hill, out of sight, as well as a new development: Banebreaker tracked the last Spirals to a neighborhood in town, but was waylaid in the Umbra by spirits clearly sent to do just that.  One of the Spirals got away, and the trail went cold.  The Talons are expecting further trouble.

      </P>
    <P>

    Just then, Peter Haveron calls Michael, controlled but upset.  Tabitha’s voice can be heard in the background.  He says, “Listen.”  Tabitha’s voice becomes louder as he places her on speaker, repeating herself.

    <P>

    The call is interrupted as the Pathstone vibrates violently, shaking and becoming hot, burning.  Lexie pulls it from her Spider Bag before it wrecks too much inside it, where it leaps and burns on the ground.  Nil instantly reacts inside the Children of None, his cold and alien hunger whirling on the stone. From the stone comes the sounds of flames, cracking and spitting, and a long, low rumbling that they feel in their bones at first, but which then rises into a scream, at first unidentifiable, then into a woman’s shriek of tortured agony, before finally resolving into a peal of laughter.  Nil manifests in the physical world and touches the stone, silencing it.

    Peter:  “Mom!  Mom, wake up!  WAKE UP, MOM!”<BR />


    Tabitha is back asleep now and Peter is trying to control himself.  After the call, Bleeding-Nine-Times speaks.
    “What is that thing?  Do not lie to me, Children of None.”<BR />


    The pack tells him the truth, appeasing him, but he remains gruff and cold.  He and his companion turn to leave.  They will not be bringing the Talons back here.<BR />


    “Good luck, Children of None.”

    <STRONG>The Darkness Below -</STRONG><BR />
    <A name='The Darkness Below' ></A>
    The Mine site is old and decrepit, and the pack navigates their way down to a hole in the bottom of the giant pit.  It’s fairly well-hidden, but the Children discover and remove the locks on the hidden door.  Disarming a spring-trap attached to the entrance, Michael leads the way into the darkness.  Further down, he is not so lucky, triggering a pressure-plate in an attempt to disarm it.  A loaded mine cart drops from above, temporarily hurting his hand, and breaking his phone.

      </P>
    <P>

    Peeking into the umbra, Khonsu falls prey to a lure.  He sends Lexie into a hidden chamber in to collect what looks like a book entitled “memories” in Arabic.  Two monstrous insectoid horrors assault the pack.  Despite the disadvantage, the pack dispatches the two Banes, called Drattosi, in short order, displaying excellent pack tactics in the dark caves.  Gabriel picks up the scent of Freakfeet in one of the corridors, but there are no signs of them otherwise.

      </P>
    <P>

    Farther down in the tunnels, Michael’s echolocation reveals they are not alone, and the pack ambushes and dispatches a gaggle of freakish humanoid miners in perfect unison.  Coming upon another group a few tunnels down, Gabriel tries to distract them with a mimicry of a Freakfoot’s gibbering voice.  It does not go well.

      </P>
    <P>

    Gabriel: “gibber-gibber. . . Wait, shit.”

      </P>
    <P>

    The miners rush the pack as Mira and Michael break off to bookend them from a switchback tunnel.  The poor freaks don't stand a chance.

      </P>
    <P>

    The miners dispatched, the pack takes stock of their surroundings.  The sounds of moving water can be heard here, coming from further down the descending cave.
    Michael tells the others that the fungus on the walls doesn’t look like cave fungus.  He’s no expert, but this stuff is hard as astroturf and doesn’t look like it could survive here.  Feeling around in the cart the miners were filling, Khonsu sees that it is half full not of stone, but of this rank fungus.  He hefts a pick-axe while talking.
    Michael and Khonsu both peek across the Gauntlet into the Umbra.  The Weaver’s Web is very thin here, and this is easier than on the surface.<BR />

    In the Umbra: The walls here are covered not in fungus but rather a very thick jelloid slime.  It reeks of corruption.

      </P>
    <P>

    The pack theorizes that this ooze is likely causing the fungus to appear in the physical world, it’s taint reflected here in this unnatural and impossible growth.  They ask themselves, to what end are the freaks collecting the fungus?

      </P>
    <P>


    <STRONG>The Thunder Down Under -</STRONG><BR />
    <A name='The Thunder Down Under' ></A>

    Michael elects to move on while continuing to look across the Gauntlet, effectively blind in the physical world, with a hand on Khonsu to guide his steps there.
    Moving on down the tunnel, Gabriel smells clean water ahead, and Michael’s sonic vision shows him a large cavern ahead, perhaps 150 yards across, 100 feet deep.  There is water below.  Before they move, however, an unwelcome sound assaults their ears: Freakfeet in the tunnel behind them.  Moving as one to intercept, the pack doubles back to try for another ambush, but when they reach the junction, things evolve.  There is a sound like sliding, like someone dragging something moist across stone.  The Freakfeet panic, their voices raising in terror.  Michael sees them in his augmented vision loping toward the pack as something chases them.  Whatever it is, it takes up the whole tunnel and it “looks” indistinct to his sense.  As well, shockingly, the thing is opening the gauntlet from the Umbra to strike at the Freakfeet like a trapdoor spider.

      </P>
    <P>

    It swallows all of them, and then it disappears from the physical world, back into the umbra.

      </P>
    <P>

    The pack organizes around Michael’s curt telepathic commands.  Mira, Khonsu, Lexie, and Gabriel set up at the junction in the umbra, hoping to surprise the thing as it passes their tunnel -if it does not elect to turn- and Michael steps into the physical world to try to get behind it.

      </P>
    <P>

    Michael doesn’t reach the backside of the thing in time -it is over 30 feet long- before Mira senses the thing before her and strikes.  Her claws sink to the elbow in thick, muscular flesh covered in mucus.  The thing ripples around her talons, trying to undulate away.<BR />

    “Mira, duck!”  Gabriel looses an arrow in the dark over Lexie’s shoulder, above Khonsu’s Hispo form.  Khonsu shifts to his natural towering Crinos and assaults the creature over Mira’s head.
    Michael, having reached the backside of the great worm, literally begins tearing it a new asshole with savage glee.
    The thing in the dark twists its gaping maw toward Mira, opening a great mouth ringed with spines like a lamprey’s, and roars as it tries to swallow her.  She rises, planting her hands on each side of the mouth, planting her feet.  The mass of the creature pushes her bodily into her packmates, and they slide backwards ten feet on the stone floor.  Between gnashes of it’s maw, a hot, ropy tongue flicks outward, tasting Mira’s face.

      </P>
    <P>

    A huge, bloody foot flies from the orifice and strikes Mira inconsequentially on the chest before dropping to the floor.

      </P>
    <P>

    Calling upon his gift, Khonsu creates several wheelbarrows worth of dirt directly in its mouth, stopping it up.  It shakes and coughs.<BR />

    “Out of the way!”  Lexie steps up to Khonsu’s back, levels the shotgun under his armpit.  Mira flattens herself against the other side of the cave.  The gun roars twice, absolutely deafening the pack (but their ears are already healing) and in the muzzle flashes, they behold the monster:  A huge, slime-covered, pale and rippling invertebrate with no eyes, mouth like a Sarlacc pit a meter and a half wide, spines projecting from it at all angles.  It bleeds dark ichor from its wounds.

      </P>
    <P>

    Mira savages it once more and the thing succumbs to its wounds and Nil devours it.  It disappears as though it never were, if not for the telltale slime on the walls.<BR />
    Michael rejoins the pack.<BR />

    </P>
    <P class='conversation'>

    Lexie:  “What the fuck was that?”<BR />


    Khonsu: “I’m having trouble believing it myself, but I think that was a juvenile Thunderwyrm.”<BR />


    Michael: “A Thunderwyrm!?  Do you realize what that means?<BR />


    Mira: “But this one wasn’t full-grown.”<BR />


    Khonsu: “This one was an infant.”<BR />


    Michael: Let me tell you a story about thunderwyrms.  Do you know who Albrecht is?  One of the greatest heroes of our age.  He killed a full-grown thunderwyrm to reclaim his silver crown at a time when we were still called the iron riders.  He and his pack fought this for hours to kill this thing.  We killed one of its children in 30 seconds.  We removed it from existence.  Thunderwyrms are some of the greatest enemies of the garou nation.”<BR />


    Lexie: “So we did good?”<BR />


    Michael: “We did real good.”

    <STRONG>The Glade Child -</STRONG><BR />
    <A name='The Glade Child' ></A>

    Continuing down to the chasm, the pack reaches the edge.  A cable is anchored to a large piton in the ceiling overhead, but its associated cable car is on the other side of the chasm and it appears to be manually operated.  Michael swells to Glabro and begins to hand-over-hand to the cart on the other side.  Once there, he removes a rudimentary braking device from the crank and begins to move the cart.   He is just half way across the chasm, when more enemy miners respond to the agonized shrieks from the cable.
</P>

<P class='conversation'>
    They rush from the side opposite the pack and begin shouting in english, “who goes there?  Announce yourself!”<BR />

    Mira responds “We have been sent to check up on your work!”<BR />

    The response is immediate: “A WOMAN?!  CUT THE CABLE!  INVADERS!”

      </P>
    <P>

    Michael leaps from the cart back toward the miners side, roaring as he monkeys down the cable on massive arms.  The miners break the piton, dropping the cable and the cart, but Michael keeps his wits and flings himself bodily the last few yards, slamming into the rocky wall on their side as he shifts into Crinos, his talons piercing the stone.  He waits and the miners retreat.  He tells the rest of the pack to climb down the cable and swim across.  Lexie leaps, laughing, and splashes down in deep water.

      </P>
    <P>

    Once they’re all across, they notice a strange pale blue radiance just barely filtering through the rushing water beneath the wall on which Michael landed.  Lexie plunges down to see and the others follow.  Surfacing after a short underwater tunnel, the pack beholds an underground room with a rocky isle at its center.  The place is awash in blue light from the bioluminescent mushrooms growing on everything, and the place smells like a forest after weeks of rain.  Faintly radiant, translucent fish swim about, feasting on the insects that alight on the water’s surface to breed.  There is life everywhere.  Underneath the ubiquitous mushrooms, among soft beds of mossy fungus are pale spiderlike insects feasting on the spores.  Other insects and even some tiny white toads feast on them.  The circle of life here is strangely fast: The insects mature in minutes, molting and flying to the water and multiplying as fast as the fish can eat them.<BR />

    One huge mushroom stands at the center of all of this on the island.  The pack steps sideways and beholds the spiritual reflection of giant decomposer: A beautiful, pale, glowing child, rooted to the spot and regarding them with calm prescience.

      </P>
    <P>

    The Glade Child informs them that it has always been here, that it used to have relatives all over, until the Black Spring appeared when the wyrm’s minions arrived, poisoning the waters and bringing balefire down below.  Now, this cave is all that is left, saved only by the rushing current upstream of the Black Spring, but the Child knows it is only a matter of time for it and its tiny kingdom.  Mira, weeping openly, tells the Child that they will never let this happen.  Bathed in the glow of the Glade, the spirits mark her words, as ever they have.  She is sworn.
    The pack leaves the Glade and ascends the wall of the chasm after a short swim back.
    Up ahead, the tunnels glow with a sickly green haze.

      </P>
    <P>

    <STRONG>The Black Spring -</STRONG><BR />
    <A name='The Black Spring' ></A>

    At the top of the precipice, the pack notices the wound on Gabriel’s face is closing, faintly glowing with the blue light of the Glade.  The Child has healed the pack.  Michael’s echolocation has worn off, but the light of the fires below are just enough for the pack to see.

      </P>
    <P>

    The sounds of the miners can be heard below, agitated and yelling back and forth over the din of machinery.  Slowly, Lexie leads the pack down to the sharp bend in the cave.  Before they reach the halfway point, the voices below quickly die down and stop.  Reaching the bend, Lexie and Michael peer around the corner.  The stench from the room has become oppressive here.  The reek of sulfur, hot petroleum, melting plastics, and something else, so bitterly astringent that it dries the sinuses of the pack.  The grim green light reveals a large cavern opening to the south, the roof more than 18’ high.  The cavern’s true size is difficult to judge because of the irregular stalagmites and smooth rocky hillocks that honeycomb the space.  A rudimentary road, wide enough to accommodate the mining carts, has been carved through the cavern, littered on each side with junk parts, broken tools, and rocky scree.  It is more a jungle of stone than an open space.  The roar of rushing water can be heard even more loudly here, echoing from deeper within the cavern.  There is no sign of anyone.

      </P>
    <P>

    The pack cautiously moves in, watching all angles, picking their way around the abandoned tools.  Khonsu picks up another pickaxe for a moment.<BR />
</P>
<P class='conversation'>
    “Still warm.”  He  looks at the pack, concerned.<BR />

    ‘What is that thing over there?”  Lexie indicates an ad-hoc building of small size, erected from a prefabricated set.  Green haze bleeds from the seams of the corrugated aluminum siding into the gloom.   The pack walks over to examine it, Michael kicking in the side of the structure.  A balefire burns unnaturally within, heating cauldrons attached to a conveyor belt which is manually operated by a large crank.
    “What does it do?”  Lexie is peering over his shoulder.<BR />

    “It’s a reducer.  It’s melting something down for further processing.”<BR />

    Lexie points to the cart full of fungus.  “This stuff?”<BR />

    Michael nods in assent, and then he removes the vital parts of the machine, warping steel in his huge Crinos hands and irreparably damaging the conveyor.<BR />

    “Not anymore,” he grunts, as the echoes of his handiwork die down around them.  No cries of alarm, no bum’s rush from freak miners.<BR />

    Michael says, “Khonsu, can you peek into the Umbra here and show us what you see?”

      </P>
    <P>

    Khonsu nods and stares into his own eyes reflected in Michael’s Mirrorshades fetish.  The Silent Strider’s eyes alight with white haze and he says to the pack, “the Gauntlet is thin here.  We’ve wandered far from the Weaver’s influence.”  His eyes narrow in anger.

      </P>
    <P class='conversation'>

    “What do you see, Khonsu?”  Michael’s voice is impatient but measured.


    “This place is crawling with Waakshani- Wyrm Elementals of toxicity . . . and I saw a Scrag.  Where there is one, there are more.”   Khonsu watches the animated slimes oozing theirs way through the cavern.  Another Scrag slouches from behind a rock before vanishing into the gloom.

    “So much for the Umbra,” Mira says.  “Let’s move on.”

      </P>
    <P>

    Following the conveyor farther into the great cavern, the pack finds another shanty.  This is the second stage refiner for the fungus processing, with it’s own conveyor extending into the darkness, toward the sounds of the water.  As Pathfinder wrecks this one, Khonsu feels his Talen earring shaking.  Query is reaching out to him.  Quickly stepping sideways after ascertaining the coast is clear, Khonsu addresses the Enigma Spirit.<BR />
</P>
<P class='conversation'>
    “Thoth’s Memory, you have a visitor.”<BR />

    “Who?”<BR />

    “A Kin-Fetch from the Red Talons,” Query replies in his queerly off-beat style.<BR />

          </P>
        <P>

    Khonsu reports the news to the others, and Michael asks Khonsu to open the way once more so Michael can step into the Umbra.  Khonsu expresses concern over the dangers there, and asks Michael why he wants to do so.

      </P>
    <P>

     Michael flatly replies, “I need Gnosis.”

       </P>
     <P>

    Khonsu parts the veil and Michael steps across.  Michael ambushes a straggler Waakshani and dispatches it in seconds.  Nil devours it, sharing some Gnosis with Pathfinder. This done, a small jay bird alights on Michael’s outstretched claw.

      </P>
    <P>

    “Have you seen the Children of None?”  The bird’s tiny eyes regard him without fear.
    Khonsu joins them and the bird tells them that Tastes-Rain is coming to join them with Banebreaker and Fifth-Wind, the alpha of the Ragabash among the local Red Talons.

      </P>
    <P>
    The pack waits.  After a time, a flash of light plays across Michael’s eyes.  Tastes-Rain is reflecting light from a shard of mirror.  The Talons approach.

      </P>
    <P>

    Banebreaker does not speak, instead walking a quick circle around the gathering, eyes to the gloom.
    Tastes-Rain breaks the silence.  “You are lucky, Children of None.  After Bites-Bad-Brothers reported to us what happened with the pathstone, I was concerned, but after Jay Bird told me of what she had seen in these caves, I knew we had to come to you.  She almost didn’t follow you.  She said there were spirit-eaters at the entrance, but that your pack ended them.  She stayed with you.”

      </P>
    <P class='conversation'>

    “We are grateful that she did so,” Khonsu says.<BR />

    Tastes-Rain allows herself a moment of pride.  “Jay Bird may not be bright, but she is loyal.”

      </P>
    <P>

    The two packs decide what should be done next.  Michael reactivates his echolocation, revealing the chamber beyond this one to his senses.  He sees a massive, open room, filled with water rushing in from the aquifer above, where they had found the Glade.  Many enemies are present in the room, more than twenty.  Over the din of the water and the incessant murmuring of their heinous prayers, it is hard to say whether they are miners or other creatures of human size.

      </P>
    <P class='conversation'>

    Lexie concentrates, listening hard.  After a moment, she says, "They're praying to Waakshan."<BR />


    Khonsu's tail dips.  "That is not a good sign.  Waakshan is the Incarna of toxicity.  It is one of the fallen elements.  This caern belongs to it."<BR />


    Tastes-Rain says that Bites-Bad-Brothers told them about the phone call to Pearl he had witnessed on the surface, and her subsequent ideas about what to do.  If the cistern in the other room is the heart of the Hive, then Fifth-Wind can open a Moon Bridge from here.<BR />


    “We can’t ask Waakshan to give us a Moon Bridge,” Michael says impatiently.  Fifth Wind scowls at him, tilting her lupine head in mockery.<BR />


    “I don’t NEED the totem’s permission.”<BR />

          </P>
        <P>

    Once the Moon Bridge is open, an emissary can have the Gatekeeper at the Long Summer open an assault Moon Bridge into the Hive using the Pathstone.  They only have to get Fifth Wind close enough to Waakshan.

      </P>
    <P>

    <STRONG>From Heart to Heart -</STRONG><BR />
    <A name='From Heart to Heart' ></A>

    Khonsu and Fifth Wind sneak into the chamber under the conveyor belt.  The balefires here reveal the vastness of the cistern and the waterfall on the far side.  The belt was dumping the refined fungus into the waters here, and although the waterfall is pure and clear, the cistern itself is a frothing soup of opaque pollution.  Some kind of spiky structure exists to the south side on the shore, with freaks gathered around it.  All of the other miners are ritually bathing in the spring.  Khonsu lowers the Pathstone into the fetid water, and nods to Fifth Wind.  She closes her eyes a moment, and then a brilliant silver light fills the cavern, erupting above the water, as the Lunes answer her Gift.  They both vanish into the portal as the cries of the freaks rise.

      </P>
    <P>

    Michael and the others watch this from the other room, and when the alarm is raised, he howls a challenge: “My name is Michael Pathfinder Strands, Beta Ahroun of the Children of None.  We are the avatars of the Balance Wyrm.  We are here to correct the abomination known as Waakshan.”<BR />

    A return howl from the room drowns out the Freaks: “We welcome your end in our Dark Waters.”

      </P>
    <P>

    On the other side of the Moon Bridge, Khonsu and Fifth Wind emerge into the heart of the Caern of the Long Summer.  Aidan Kingsley stands there, blinking surprise at them.  The sounds of combat can be heard in the woods around the Dreaming Tree.  Pearl stands just yards away in human form as always, her back to the two newcomers, regarding the Tree.  The huge, ancient Ginkgo twists and bends, pulling its roots free from the earth in an effort to leave.  Several garou unknown to Khonsu are chanting around it in an unfamiliar Indian language.  Pearl whirls to face them, striding over and grasping Khonsu by the fur.  Blood soaks her sleeve and mats her blonde hair.  It does not appear to be her own.

      </P>
    <P class='conversation'>

    “Khonsu, what is happening?”<BR />


    “Pearl, beyond this bridge lies the heart of a Black Spiral caern.  We need you.”<BR />


    Pearl shakes the Theurge once in urgency.  “ARE YOU THERE NOW?”<BR />


    “Yes.”<BR />


    Pearl River wheels about, swinging a bloody arm over her head in broad circles, her normally soft voice booming, “TO ME!”  A chorus of howls answers her.
