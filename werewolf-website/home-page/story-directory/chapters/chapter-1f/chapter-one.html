    <BR /> It is Tuesday, March 10th, 2016. There has been a calamity which struck San Diego six months ago. Two targets were hit:
    The San Diego Monroe House and its adjacent farmland. The Newspapers call it a “terrorist attack.” The National Guard’s
    presence in San Diego is high. The NSA is monitoring most traffic throughout the city through the use of checkpoints
    and RFID tags mandated on motor vehicles. Cameras have been installed in many places throughout the city. Certain civil
    rights have been suspended in favor of “National Security,” including random stops and search points at certain places
    in the city, as well as the suspension of the right to peaceful assembly. A curfew is in effect.

    <STRONG>The Pack is Born-</STRONG>
    <A name='The Pack is Born'></A>
    <BR /> The motley band of pups have endured crash courses in Garou history and society, mocking japes from ranking Sept members,
    brutal lessons from Constance Mercer, and no small amount of yard work. One night they are abducted by hooded figures
    and Papa Eddy, the Sept’s Den Father, and driven into the Preserve at the heart of Balboa park, chased and harried by
    unnamed werewolves directly into the personal space of the Dreaming Tree itself.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>A Planned Emergency-</STRONG>
    <A name='A Planned Emergency'></A>
    <BR /> Khonsu makes contact with the powerful spirit, and it opens a Moon Bridge to unknown parts in an effort to "rescue"
    the five younglings. After an odd jaunt through a Moon Bridge (and a less-than-friendly encounter with mischievous Lunes,
    fascinated by Khonsu's odd brains) the pups arrive in the deep Canadian wilderness, greeted by the lukewarm Warder of
    the Sept of the Winter Wolf and fledgling pack led by the impetuous Ice Dagger. The pups are led to a "cozy" dwelling
    and instructed to await further orders for their impending Rite of Passage. Feeling suspicious, they keep a watch throughout
    the night.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Framed-</STRONG>
    <A name='Framed'></A>
    <BR /> Early in the morning, they are awakened by a commotion and unceremoniously escorted to the heart of the Caern, confronted
    by the Sept's elders and community. Under the stony gaze of the Wendigo sept, the pups are told that their Sept has murdered
    the pups belonging to the Winter Wolf and that their Rite of Passage is no longer to be carried out. "We cannot kill
    you for your elder's transgressions, but if you return here, you will no longer be protected by the Litany." The Sept's
    Philodox appears uncomfortable with this decision. The pups are turned out into the wild as the Winter Wolf seals the
    bawn and sets up War Watch. Electing to head toward what Ayita is certain is Toronto, the pups begin to move NE through
    the deep, cold wilderness.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Winter Wonderland-</STRONG>
    <A name='Winter Wonderland'></A>
    <BR /> As the weather gradually worsens, the pups travel on four legs in search of prey, and they track a pair of moose, only
    to realize that they aren't the only hunters on the trail. Breaking into two groups, the pack brings down the prey and
    the beast, a Bane-possessed bear, whose fallen spirit they attempt to honor. The pack fashions basic tools, bags, and
    a waterskin in short order. They set off under a darkening sky as the winds pick up. Before full darkness, the pack creates
    an impressive ad hoc shelter, and Mira and Michael gather firewood in the dark, experiencing an unsettling and inexplicable
    moment. They settle in for the night, and after a few short hours of sleep, Khonsu senses they are not alone.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Stranger Danger-</STRONG>
    <A name='Stranger Danger'></A>
    <BR /> He alerts the pack and they step outside to investigate the eerie howls of Garou in the dead of the freezing night.
    At first, darkness, and then. . . Three Garou, one standing tall on Crinos legs, the others pensive and still, staring
    immobile at the camp with wolf eyes. Strangers.
    <BR /> Having responded to the plaintive howls for succor that awakened them, the Pack stepped out to investigate. In a moment
    of weird light, the Pack observes the three Garou on the ridge just above their lean-to in the blizzard, silhouetted
    in the darkness, one standing the full height of the war-form, the two flanking him as wolves. None move. Before the
    light vanishes, Ayita uses her Gift to touch the mind of the tall one, asking who he is.
    <BR /> "We are lost. Someone is hurt. Please." And then, nothing.
    <BR /> Mira and Michael break away to investigate, leaving the others to guard the camp. On the ridge, in the darkness, there
    is no sign of passage. Not even a footprint. The Philodox and Ahroun are considering this quandary, when they are approached
    by a very young Garou in Crinos form, the one from the Ridge. He implores them to follow him, claiming someone is hurt.
    Michael notes he has no scent, and leaves no footprints. Mira sees he exhales no steam. He is grievously wounded in the
    face and back. Warily, on eight feet they set off with him.
    <BR /> He leads them a way into the wild, eventually claiming his head hurts and suffering amnesia regarding his memory. They
    find an unremarkable tree and the young entity begins to behave erratically. He speaks to unseen persons before turning
    his back to Mira, and vanishing. They dig around the base of the tree and their efforts reveal a body, bearing the same
    wounds as the vanishing boy, well-preserved and hastily stuffed into the exposed tree roots. Further examination reveals
    a small silver chip, embedded in the corpse's face, which Michael removes. They return to camp and fetch the others.
    Together they search more and locate a rabbit's foot fetish and not much else. Michael turns it over to Mira and there
    is a tense moment of argument about what it does.
    <BR /> The pack brings the body and the chip back to camp, Michael buries the body shallowly outside camp, fearing potential
    issues, spiritually, for having it in the shelter. The pack sleeps and Michael volunteers for first watch.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Foul Play-</STRONG>
    <A name='Foul Play'></A>
    <BR /> In the morning, the pack awakens to discover that the body was exhumed in the night and the head removed. Tracks lead
    from there to the northeast. After another tense moment between the cubs over the new situation with the body's missing
    head, the cubs examine the area very carefully and see that the tracks leave camp and head NE. They gather what they
    have, including the body, and track NE. The miles go by and the tracks dead end. It is suggested that the interloper
    may have entered the Umbra. Michael and Khonsu state that if this is the case, the head would be left behind. Khonsu
    peeks into the Umbra but his powers fail him.
    <BR /> Mira volunteers to look as well, and sees that the tracks do indeed continue to the NE, fading into the haze. The pups
    have only been here for a few minutes before the noise of the helicopter they heard earlier passing overhead drives them
    all to pause and hide, except for Mira, who is attempting to open the Gauntlet and having trouble with it. The chopper
    makes an additional pass, this time settling in above the Pack. Mira concentrates hard, but is too late, and a shot rings
    out from the craft, striking her Hispo form in the hide. She shakes it off and makes for the trees. A second shot splits
    the air and this time the slug Wounds her as she scrambles for cover.
    <BR /> Lexie darts across the clearing, creating a distraction, while Michael heads to a similar location, having sighted some
    larger rocks. More shots from above miss the pack. Ayita assumes the Crinos form under a snowy evergreen. The gunner
    pauses to reload his weapon. Michael rips a stone the size of a soccer ball from the frozen earth and hurls it at the
    low-hovering craft. The craft yaws in an attempt to avoid it, but the stone strikes the tail rotor, bending it far enough
    that the blades chew into the tail itself, sending the craft into an uncontrolled clockwise spin to the southwest. The
    gunner leaps free, attempting to escape the crash, but Ayita has torn loose a five foot branch of evergreen and, roaring,
    sidearms it toward him. The fence-post-sized branch spins at him and strikes him dead-center. He tumbles to the ground
    as the chopper erupts into flames, vanishing over the tree line.
    <BR /> The pack splits up. Mira and Ayita head for the gunner, the rest for the wrecked chopper. After salvaging what they
    can (including a rifle and some bullets), Khonsu, Michael, and Lexie enjoy a smoke and a few beers, then head back. That's
    when more gunfire erupts from Mira and Ayita's location. The three other Cubs run.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Salvage and Question-</STRONG>
    <A name='Salvage and Question'></A>
    <BR /> At the site of the fallen gunman, Mira secures the weapon and interrogates the shooter, summoning the spiritual gift
    of persuasion. Ayita stands back, wanting to avoid the Delirium. The shooter babbles through shattered ribs about "the
    eldritch lady" and how the Cubs would be harvested, how they would "split the mountain, open the mountain" and he threatens
    the pack, stating that their "blood will run over stone, like the others." He begins to change, skin flaking and falling
    away during the interrogation, revealing a chitinous, crab-like horror beneath. Ayita forces a mind-link through dreamtime
    with him for a time, but eventually he resists and Mira shoots him, with little effect. She assaults the monster with
    claws. The others catch up, stopping 175 meters from their pack mates and Michael stops them, raising his rifle in the
    direction of Mira and Ayita. He calls upon the powers of his human ancestral Gift to steady his aim. His shot silences
    the crab Fomori for good. Movement in the distance catches Michael's eye and he fires again.
    <BR /> Suddenly the woods are alive with movement and an icy wind blasts Mira from nowhere, as a Garou assailant bears down
    on her. Ayita's attempt to intercept fails spectacularly and arrows begin to whistle past. Mira charges the figure, passing
    right through it like smoke, as Khonsu stands by Lexie, who is furiously tapping away at the phone. Michael sights down
    the barrel once more, focusing, as Mira's paws skid across the snowy earth. . . The Pack engages the unknown enemies
    in a pitched battle, divided into two groups.
    <BR /> Lexie and Michael close ground only to be interrupted by garou as Khonsu makes a run for the discarded body they have
    carried all this way. Mira and Ayita struggle against a phantom enemy and a chilling wind.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Hello Again-</STRONG>
    <A name='Hello Again'></A>
    <BR /> Michael finds himself dodging knives and ultimately disarming and defeating Ice Dagger with his own klaive. Maia throats
    the enemy's Galliard, and upon hearing the Pack of Stormwinter's alpha has fallen, the Wendigo Garou all surrender.
    <BR
    /> After some questionable diplomacy, the packs each agree that Ice Dagger must reach the Winter Wolf quickly in order
    to ensure he does not die before paying for his breach of the Litany. The Lost Cubs are not accompanying them. They will
    continue their search for the missing head with the help of acting Stormwinter alpha Snow-Tail.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Insufferable Enki-</STRONG>
    <A name='Insufferable Enki'></A>
    <BR /> The packs split and Snow-Tail takes them to the head, back the way they came, before leaving for the Sept. After a short
    discussion, a stranger’s howl hails them from the NorthWest. This individual is the enigmatic Enki-the-Shadowless, a
    Silent Strider dispatched from the Long Summer in an attempt to locate the missing Cubs. Enki informs the pack that Pearl
    and a contingent of garou are arriving to speak with the Winter Wolf but are not aware of just how serious things have
    become. Enki believes that they are walking into a trap. Mira explains the situation to him and Enki recommends a shortcut
    through the Dark Umbra, saying they can kill two birds with one stone: speak to the departed soul of the murdered Cub,
    and get back to the Winter Wolf faster than on earth. The cubs accept.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Sam Black Pine-</STRONG>
    <A name='Sam Black Pine'></A>
    <BR /> When they reach the site of the murder, Enki performs a minor sacrifice and opens the Gauntlet into the Shadowlands.
    The pack follows and they are treated to a monument of bleakness. The Dark Umbra here is a blasted, gray and skeletal
    wilderness. The cubs locate the victim, locked in some sort of frenetic digging. They learn that his name was Sam Black
    Pine, a cub on his rite of passage with the Wendigo Tribe (and Ice Dagger) months earlier. Sam is unaware of his condition
    and believes himself to be trapped in the Umbra as punishment for failing the Rite. The Lost Cubs tell Sam the truth:
    he did not survive his rite and will not leave the Umbra unless he can help bring Ice Dagger to justice. Sam tells them
    all he can recall, including where to find the other murdered cubs, and begs them to tell his father what happened to
    him, and to repeat the phrase “goodnight for now.”
    <BR /> "
    <EM>Remember me</EM>,” are his last words.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>The Hunters Hunted-</STRONG>
    <A name='The Hunters Hunted'></A>
    <BR /> Armed with this information, the pack is finally ready to go to the Sept of the Winter Wolf. Enki entreats them to hustle
    but they run into serious trouble along the way: a LARGE pack of Ooralath -a half-manifest armored war hound known for
    ambushing Garou- are stalking them. They are outnumbered and Enki bellows to “RUN, there are always more!” With enough
    headway on the pack, Enki drops a Talen which fascinates most of the Ooralath for a minute, while he tries to open the
    Gauntlet. It takes longer than expected, and some of the Hounds engage them. Mira, Michael, and Ayita stand frontline
    and Lexie and Khonsu form a vanguard to protect Enki. After a battle/race against time, the deadbox fails and the portal
    opens. The pack spills unceremoniously through just as the Ooralath catch up.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Canadian Standoff-</STRONG>
    <A name='Canadian Standoff'></A>
    <BR /> Back at the Winter Wolf Sept, Pearl and the others are drawing near the Bawn. The Wendigo are waiting, and the trap
    is set. Enki says to the pups that the chase forced them out of their shortcut early, so they run, again, all the way
    to the Sept. Night has fallen and the Pack arrives just as a standoff is ensuing between the Winter Wolf and the ad hoc
    pack led by Pearl River herself. The septs agree after a very tense moment and some loosed arrows from Constance to talk
    it out.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>The Right Rite-</STRONG>
    <A name='The Right Rite'></A>
    <BR /> The Cubs relate their story to Pearl and the Winter Wolf’s elders, and they speak to Sam’s father, Cracks-the-Bone,
    who accepts the fetish they found. Before much more can be made certain, Snow-Tail bursts into the Caern’s lodge, wounded
    and nearly hysterical. The Pack of Stormwinter has been massacred by what was Ice Dagger. He has been possessed by a
    False Wendigo, and his weakened state permitted the final stages of possession. It is decided that the Cub’s Rite of
    Passage will be to track the Demon back to its lair and remove its icy heart. After notable insubordination and then
    a night of rest, the pack is anointed by sacred firelight with powerful war-paint, armed with Bane Dagger and a bow with
    Obsidian Arrows, and set on the trail of the Wendigo.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Trail of the Wendigo-</STRONG>
    <A name='Trail of the Wendigo'></A>
    <BR /> Khonsu leads the pack with his enhanced eyes on the trail of the Wendigo, starting from the last place Snow-Tail saw
    it. The carnage is awesome to behold. When the trail threatens to go cold, ghostly wolves appear and vanish, pointing
    the way, howling directions only Khonsu can hear, or simply running alongside the pack like shadowy brothers and sisters.
    The pack reaches a small cave set in a rocky hillside and before they can enter, ghosts appear to Khonsu once more, one
    of them the shade of Sam Black Pine. In succession, they announce their names: John Sleeping Bear. Eats-Pinecones. Sam
    Black Pine. They say to him, “remember us.”
    <BR /> The pack sees a glyph on the stone and Khonsu reads it as “Hidden” but there should be more. Michael desecrates the
    glyph with claws, and taunts the demon inside the cave, but to no avail.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Bones, Blood, and Boss Fights-</STRONG>
    <A name='Bones, Blood, and Boss Fights'></A>
    <BR /> The pack enters the cave and come upon an odd scene: odd glyphs reading “Sacrifice --- Nothing” are carved into the
    wall. At the end of the narrow corridor is a chamber with a rough-hewn table laden with savory meats of all kinds: Duck,
    turkey, venison. . . and a kindly-looking old man –who REEKS of the Wyrm- enters the room and attempts to convince them
    to join him for dinner. The pack is not amused and immediately they confront him. Michael kicks the dishes over. The
    old man howls and changes into a 9-foot beast of thin blue skin, ice, and glowing bones visible beneath. It has no feet
    but blackened stumps and gaping mouth full of broken teeth. It’s eyes burn and khonsu can see small Gaffling spirits
    spinning off of its body. They look like short, eyeless children with gray skin, huge, needle-filled maws, no feet, and
    black fingers. They run on the air around the cavern and a howling wind kicks up. Mira manages to pierce the heart of
    the Wendigo with an arrow as the rest of the pack battles the spirits. Ayita and Michael cling to its spindly body, clawing
    and stabbing, as Lexie casts the net and Khonsu unleashes hell in the form of an angry fire elemental hidden under his
    tongue. The Wendigo perishes. Before the cubs can even celebrate, the glyphs shatter and a voice fills the cavern. It
    is the sound of absolute nothingness.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>Nil-Yen-Obscura-</STRONG>
    <A name='Nil-Yen-Obscura'></A>
    <BR /> The voice belongs to an ancient Incarna avatar calling itself Nil-Yen-Obscura. It claims to have expected the pack,
    and it shows Khonsu, Mira, and Ayita a vision of the beginning of the fall of the Triat. After a heated debate and the
    arrival of Mira’s ancestor, the famed Cassandra, Lexie and Michael find an old and powerful fetish, (as foretold by Cassandra)
    and Enki returns. He fetches Pearl and it is decided that Michael will bravely bear the ancient Balance Wyrm spirit back
    home to the Sept of the Long Summer.
  </P>

  <P>
    <STRONG>I Told You They’d Make It-</STRONG>
    <A name='I Told You They’d Make It'></A>
    <BR /> The Cubs head back to the Winter Wolf in a rush. The Cubs are taken into a lodge and brought before the sept’s leaders
    once more, and this time if not their lives are what is at stake, at the least, the honor of their sept. Ayita and Mira
    speak to the Elders and the Cubs are celebrated with a Rite of Accomplishment by the enchanted Tale Fire as the Sept
    looks on. Ayita’s recounting of events is a bit of a stammering, but the Wendigo keep straight faces, except No Moon
    Tonight, who can’t suppress a chuckle. The cubs are recognized by the Sept’s elders and the spirits who watch. Mira is
    accepted into the Black Furies, and named “Howl Fatale.” Lexie is accepted into the Glass Walkers, and named “Hack Slash.”
    Ayita is accepted into the Uktena, and named “Dreamspeaker.” Khonsu is accepted into the Silent Striders, and named “Remembers-Us.”
    Michael is accepted into the Glass Walkers, and named “Pathfinder.” The revelries begin, but before long, the wolves
    of the Long Summer are on a moon bridge back home.
  </P>

  <P>
    NOTE: The player portraying Ayita had to leave the chronicle due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, which led to
    the following swap of Ayita for Gabriel, played by Kelley Shelton, into the story as the pack’s new Galliard. Ayita was
    played for two sessions by the storyteller until the character’s exit scene. Check the prophecies for how I made this
    cannon.
