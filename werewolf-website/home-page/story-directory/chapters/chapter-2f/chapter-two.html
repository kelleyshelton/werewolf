  <STRONG>Where the Heart Is-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='Where the Heart Is' ></A>
After arriving back at the Long Summer, the cubs are welcomed home by Papa Eddy and everyone showers and collapses into slumber into their very own, albeit still unfamiliar beds.  The following morning, they are awakened at 6:00 AM by Michael, insistent that they take a run as a Pack in the Preserve.  They get leave from Eddy, who informs the Warders, and the pack is allowed inside after much grumbling from Lexie.  After basic training, the pack steps into the Umbra to commune with Nil, finally accepting it as their totemic spirit.  Lexie tries to reach Luca, but only receives voicemail.
</P>

<P>
BottleCap Jackson runs into them in the park and informs them of Kinkead’s plans to intercept Pitt, a local gang leader and suspect Lunatic Garou who may (slim chance, according to Pearl) know something about what happened at the Monroe House.  Pearl approves this plan and the pack meets with Kinkead.<BR />
Kinkead says they are to go downtown, incognito, and set a trap for the gang, attempting to capture or eliminate Pitt, in that order of importance.  The two young packs agree to meet later for the operation and then the Pack returns to Inspiration Heights once more.   They request a training session with Constance, who agrees to run them through the basics of knife training.  After an hour or so, most leave the Arena, with Mira staying behind to train.  Michael meets with his Kin in the Den, Lexie gets coffee, and the pack does their own thing for a bit before collectively running into Gabriel in the garden.<BR />
Gabriel Stoek is toiling away under the tutelage of Tyrese Bannister in the Zen Garden, (he has been witness to a vision the Garden showed him, and tasked with watching over the Pack by Bannister) and they exchange origin stories.  The pack speaks briefly with Adele in the Herbarium and then they disperse once more to prepare for the night’s events.  Gabriel, meanwhile, has left the grounds to speak with the crows that surround the area at dusk.  (Out Of Game note: This is the murder of hundreds and hundreds which ACTUALLY DOES live in the area.  I see them all the time.)  He manages to strike a deal with a pair of crows, and in exchange for a week’s worth of bread, they agree to follow the pack to their destination and report to him.  He departs for the downtown area and patrols the less savory neighborhoods.
</P>

<STRONG>Walking the Scab-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='Walking the Scab' ></A>
Later, the pack takes a cab down to the downtown area and meets with Sneak Thief and Kinkead at the Onyx.  Mira charms the bouncer and in they go.  The deal with Pitt goes about as expected, and the ladies snap pictures of the gang leader on the fly.  Pitt leaves with Kinkead and the pack follows, splitting up into two groups: Ayita, Mira, and Lex, and Michael and Khonsu.  Lexie and Mira elect to enter the Umbra and make their way to the Parking Structure that way.  Exiting the Umbra, Lex is caught between worlds and shown horrible things while trapped in the Gauntlet.  Mira pulls her through and holds her until she returns to her senses.  Meanwhile, the boys are arriving ahead of Pitt, thanks to traffic.  The ladies and Khonsu are set up on the 2nd floor of the dilapidated garage, while Michael waits below.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>The Stingers Stung-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='The Stingers Stung' ></A>
Pitt arrives and the deal goes wrong.  One of the thugs pulls a gun on Kinkead from behind, and Sneak Thief appears from nowhere, screaming bloody murder and rushing the thugs.  Michael springs into action, Ayita takes off upstairs to drop in on the enemies from above, Lexie throws a shoe, and first Mira, then Khonsu leap from the landing to disarm the gang members.  Michael’s knife makes short work of the driver, while Pitt moves with inhuman speed on the other side of the car.  A shot rings out above and Lex sees the body of Ayita, blown off her feet, hitting the ground upstairs to her right.  Gabriel appears from the third floor, having scaled the building from behind to guard the pack from above, and leaps down onto the sniper who shot Ayita, knocking him flat and sending the rifle skidding.  The sniper, a vampire, rolls onto his back and snaps a shot from a hastily drawn pistol, missing the snarling werewolf, who opens the Leech from crotch to throat with claws, ending his unnatural existence.
</P>

<P>
Michael sees Pitt’s nature as the fangs come out, bursting into Crinos and shouting “VAMPIRE” as he soars over the top of the car, narrowly missing Sneak Thief, who was also headed for Pitt.  Pitt bashes the Ahroun with the torn-free car door, but the Glass Walker takes no notice, ending the vampire’s unlife with claws, as Nil drinks the bounty, erasing Pitt from reality.  One òf the leeches is thrown to the ground by Gabriel and then savaged by Khonsu and Michael.  The other is pitched bodily by Gabriel onto the ground and then tries to run.  Lexie plants a slug from the rifle into him, but, amazingly, he makes it to the street, where an SUV driven by Double Ugly (Metis from the Underdogs) runs him over.  “Did you see that?”  He grins hideously.
</P>

<P>
After the fight, the Underdogs state that Lieutenant Rudy Ahlgren, kinfolk police officer (who brought Lexie to Inspiration Heights after her first change) arrives in a police cruiser with lights off, having been called by “Dolla” Bill, Double-Ugly, and Shakey Blake.  Michael, not having been appraised of this (he was occupied with the barely-breathing ghoul) takes off in an attempt to draw the law away from the scene, firing a single round into the hood of the cruiser.  Rudy and the pack stage the scene and Michael agrees to hack up the Lieutenant’s arms a little, as well as shoot him in his armored vest, the better to make a hero of him. Rudy makes a false call to his colleagues and the packs escape in two vehicles.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>She’s Not Going To Make It-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='She’s Not Going To Make It' ></A>
The ride home is a harrowing one for the SUV bearing Ayita, who is babbling in her fugue.  As Khonsu shifts just one hand into talons in order to perform the most primitive triage imaginable, she speaks to him:
</P>

<P>
  <UL class='poetry-riddles'>

<LI>“To the Endless Sun a family is born</LI><BR />

<LI>The Daughters and Sons of the war</LI><BR />

<LI>The Winter will take them and in return the children will steal the heart of the liar.</LI><BR />

<LI>The lost will return with Nothing.”</LI><BR />

<LI>Amidst her fevered ramblings and some babble:</LI><BR />

</UL>

</P>

<P>
Finally, the Mira, Lex and Khonsu arrive at Inspiration Heights.  The SenTree stirs as they cross the threshold, and Dahlia answers the door.  She rushes the trio and their fallen sister into the Laundry Room, sweeping aside the clothes and placing Ayita on the stainless steel table.  She instructs the pack to remove the front of a laundry machine, revealing a secret surgical field suite within.  She and Khonsu get to work.  Michael and Gabriel are on their way.  Khonsu discovers that the bullet has created a swelling of the aorta and that Ayita is essentially bleeding to death internally.  There is no choice but to attempt to remove the slug.  Michael and Gabriel arrive in the room, and the surgery continues.
Just then, a small child appears in the doorway with Adele, claiming that she is sick.  Adele isn’t sick.  She is having her baby, and as her water breaks, Ayita wakes up.  She speaks to the pack, telling them that she has seen the future, visions of their place, and hers.
</P>

<P class='conversation'>

“I have seen so much.  Phoenix was right.  So much depends on you all.  Protect the Glade.  Feed Nil.  Fight for the world.”   She pleads with Khonsu to help Dahlia and Adele deliver the child, which is breech, and coming right now.  After speaking to the pack, she grabs Gabriel and fulfills her own prophecy, delivering Nil Yen Obscura to him, and subjecting him to the same visions the pack saw in the cave in Canada.
When it is all over, Ayita is gone, and the pack is silent.  Then, the cry of a baby.  Khonsu says, “It’s a girl.”<BR />

Adele says to them all, “I want to call her Hope.  Hope Ayita Liddell.”
</P>

<P>
Janessa, Ayita’s mother, arrives as the house shudders again.  The scene is ugly as she becomes hysterical, screaming at Michael, who takes the blame in stoic assent.  In an effort to console her, Khonsu uses his Eyes of the D’uat to see into the Shadowlands, hopefully to speak with Ayita’s ghost, but finds only a dark passenger in the room with them.  The spirit clings to Lexie, and it notices Khonsu noticing it.    Papa Eddy sees Janessa off the property and Michael storms from the room to dispose of the bodies outside.  Eddy speaks to Khonsu about the upcoming moot and his role in Ayita’s Gathering for the Departed.  Lexie goes out back to smoke and takes a call from Luca.  Most of the pack retires to bed as the full moon rises in the silent sky over Inspiration Heights.  Michael continues to brood over the dumpster fire of his foes’ bodies in another town until the early hours. Eventually he, too, returns home.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>The First Day Of The Rest Of Your Lives-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='The First Day Of The Rest Of Your Lives' ></A>
In the morning, Michael rouses the pack but finds Lexie in a strange state, standing over an empty crib in the Nursery.  The pack arises for their constitutional and gets coffee from Starbucks for the warders (Gabriel is already up and feeding the crows, who are irritably grateful) and after an embarrassing display by both Michael and Lexie, they make their way to the Caern, where they are met by Tyrese Bannister.  He informs them of the nature of the Prophecies around Gabriel’s involvement in the fight last night and Ayita’s subsequent fate.  He says there was nothing to be done, and that if it was not her, it would have been the pack.  After their talk, the Children return to Inspiration heights.  Michael tasks his kin with setting up storage units, shopping, and beginning a search for another place to live, away from the Heights.  Gabriel prepares his speech for the moot, Lexie takes a nap, Khonsu, after consulting Adele, gathers his materials for the Ayita’s gathering for the departed at the moot tonight. Mira cleaned up and attempted to relax a bit, and after a quick chat with Gabriel and Khonsu, she retires to her shared room with Lexie.
</P>

<P>
Lexie’s sleep is fitful so Mira wakes her up, whereupon Lexie relates to Mira that she had a terrible dream.  In her dream, Lexie was back in her old apartment, which was in flames around her.   She stared into her own eyes in the bathroom mirror, and the reflection which looked back seized her, laughing, and drove its thumbs into her eyes, rupturing them.  As the blood flowed down her cheeks, Lexie herself joined the reflection in manic glee.
</P>

<P>
Disturbed, Mira consults Khonsu away from Lexie, telling him of the dream, and that’s when he tells Mira what he saw in the Laundry Room when Ayita died last night.
</P>

<P>
Khonsu heads to Garden to gather sand from the Zen Garden and confer with the spirit, as well as a few other things.
</P>

<P>
Mira speaks to Alessandra in the Dog Run, who is wheelchair-bound and wheezing through her scorched lungs.  Afterward, Mira asks Michael to help her learn the basics of firearms, which he gladly does.
</P>

<P>
The day passes, and that night the pack goes to Preserve with Papa Eddy and the linen-wrapped body of their fallen packmate, Ayita.  Aunt Maybe performs the Rite of Cleansing as they enter the Preserve.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>The Dreaming Tree-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='The Dreaming Tree' ></A>
At the moot, Pearl, Howls-in-Dreams, and Papa Eddy make their announcements, sing the praises of the Sept’s recent victories, and Howls-in-Dreams opens the Rite with a dancing, howling tribute to the Glade.  Leti Fernandez “Sings-for-the-Future” leads the Sept in the opening howl.
After, Howls offiicates Ayita’s death rites, and Khonsu performs the sacraments.  The Glade blesses her with a single leaf, and she is cremated.
</P>

<P>
Then, Pearl and Howls address the Sept about the dire need to perform their chiminage to the Glade.  The Glade needs the Sept to redouble its efforts to found new Caerns.   The Sept dances and sings and offers Gnosis to Glade, which responds by summoning Englings for the Run.
</P>

<P>
The Pack runs down their Engling, a great hundred-horned, six-legged stag, and they end its run honorably, saving it from Nil.  No sooner than their victorious howl, the Children of None hear a howl of alarm from Howls-in-Dreams himself, signaling that the Glade has gone walkabout.  The packs of the Long Summer split up across the Preserve to find their totem.
</P>

<P>
Khonsu asks for aid, first from gaian spirits, and next from Owl, who informs him of the Glade’s general whereabouts and chastises him for his sept’s neglect of their Caern’s needs.  Michael and Gabriel find the scent of the Glade in the physical world, and the pack tracks it both through there and the Penumbra, ultimately following it out of the Preserve and into the Zoo.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Preservoir Dogs-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='Preservoir Dogs' ></A>
The Pack finds the Glade in Sasquatch form in the Gorilla enclosure, attempting to heal a sick primate while the other apes watch.  Michael, peeking through the Gauntlet, notices a group of animals approaching in the physical world.  He alerts the others, and together, they cross the Gauntlet, but it takes a minute, and when they get into the physical world, they are witnessing a showdown between the Glade and the 7 corrupted coyotes who have entered the enclosure and threaten the Totem.
</P>

<P>
Gabriel vaults the wall, and Michael leg-ups the others.  Once inside, the battle begins.
The Pack rushes the beasts, who have the Gorillas and the Glade corralled in the artificial cave the apes call home.  During the fight, the monstrous coyotes sprout pseudopods from their sides and assault the pack and Glade alike.  The Glade summons forth a protective wall of thorny brambles from the earth, impeding the Fomor’s progress, and the Gabe takes advantage of the natural weapons, hurling the monsters into the spiky wyldling.  Mira leaps into the fray, biting and mauling, rewarded with victory but poisoned by the fomor’s spores.  Lexi suffers a similar misfortune as she tag-teams a pair of enemies with Khonsu.    Michael hangs back after hurling a blade, observing a moment as some of the monsters defeated by his mates burst into clouds of noxious spores.  Hanging from the fence up high, he levels his pistol, and finishes the fight his mates started.
</P>

<P>
 After the battle, Michael sets about gathering and hiding the bodies that weren’t consumed by Nil, and then the pack sets off on the trail of the Glade.  Lexie hacks the security cameras of the enclosure with her Gift, cleaning up the fight and all but erasing all evidence that they were ever there.
Khonsu makes contact with an Owl, who offers not much in the way of help, but is sentimentally predisposed to him.  Gabriel meets Michael and Khonsu and then the pack reunites when the howls of Constance herald her approach.  Constance tells the others that she will look after the Glade, and they should return to the moot.
</P>


<P>
<STRONG>Talesongs, Texts, Triage, and Terrible Dreams-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='Talesongs, Texts, Triage, and Terrible Dreams' ></A>
Back at the moot, Gabe performs a rite of accomplishment and tells the recent tales of our pack, from the feud in the parking garage to the battle in the zoo.

<P>
The pack returns to the Sept and tends to their wounds and afflictions of poison with clear water, brought by Michael, curing the infections from the fomori.
</P>


<P class='conversation'>

Lexi cracks Pitt’s phone and reads his texts to and from a man called Santiago: <BR/>

Pitt’s Text transcripts to Santiago: <BR/>

Pitt: So these assholes are looking to become buyers <BR/>

Santiago : Do they check out? <BR/>

Pitt: tough to say, but then again, none of these small-timers check out <BR/>
	they’re young though <BR/>

Santiago: how young? <BR/>

Pitt: seriously they look like fucking kids <BR/>

Santiago: Kindred? Or mortals on the take? <BR/>

Pitt:  They’re not Kindred, nah.  And too young to be cops. <BR/>
	So, what you want me to do? <BR/>

Santiago: Treat them like any other deal.  If they’re good for the flow, they could be a direct line into high schools for the Ace. <BR/>

Pitt: And if they’re no-go or things go pear-shaped? <BR/>

Santiago: Finish them.  Fangs first, or pop them.  Whatever makes sense. <BR/>

Pitt: You want any awake? <BR/>

Santiago: Girls only, if they’re kids. <BR/>

Pitt: I’ll be in touch after.  I lost the address to the compound.  re-send it? <BR/>

Santiago:  No.  I told you no numbers on this phone.  Use the cloud.  Remember the password? <BR/>

Pitt: Yeah, sorry. <BR/>

Santiago: And don’t call.  I’m on the line with her after this and it could be awhile.  Check the cloud for the address and finish business tonight.  I’ll see you tomorrow.
</P>

<P>
After each of them falls asleep, Khonsu dreams of being chased through a forest, seeing the upside-down face of a child where a moon ought to be. Drums pound as he runs and his heart beats so hard that blood pours from his nose into his chest,  and the voice of Ayita rings clear in his mind: “The woman of Blood will crack the mountain and map the hand of the Wyrm and the sky will watch and weep.  Little Brother will die fighting.”
  Khonsu awakens, in Crinos form atop his shredded bedsheets and shares his vision with his concerned pack.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>The Dark Passenger-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='The Dark Passenger' ></A>
Michael and Gabriel elect to go for a competitive run down to the park and back, during which Michael handily beats Gabe every step of the way, but does not ridicule the out-of-shape Stargazer, who resolves to train hard.  Meanwhile, Lexie falls back asleep, under the watchful eye of her alpha.  Sure enough, Lexie rises from bed, sleepwalking, and Mira follows her as the house creaks and groans in pointed protest at an unwanted visitor.  Lexie enters the nursery, fixated on the empty crib once again, and the horror in her head reaches a crescendo.  Mira awakens her and Lexie seems confused before a phantom image washes over Mira’s face, panicking her into action.  She shifts into Crinos and clumsily ‘defends’ herself against her tormentor, capsizing the cradle and face planting hard.  Mira shifts in response and chokes her mate unconscious, just as Khonsu arrives to investigate.
</P>

<P>
During this time, Gabe and Michael are arriving and are greeted by a tense Constance at the gate, who asks them to check the perimeter in the back.  Gabriel and Michael oblige, finding nothing and stepping sideways to speak to the SenTree, who informs them that “someone uninvited is coming and going as they please.”  After some semantic gymnastics, they go into the house to witness the crisis in the Nursery.  Christopher Mercer walks in to see what's up, and goes to fetch tea.  He returns with Constance  and they catch A snippet of the conversation.  Michael spills about Lexie’s problem, and Constance throws them out in a fury over their recklessness in bringing such a spirit onto the grounds.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>This Ain’t the Ritz-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='This Ain’t the Ritz' ></A>
The pack retires to a motel in Hotel Circle and Mira and Michael step sideways to have a spirited argument about the revelation to Constance, wherein Michael issues a challenge for Alpha, to take place in two weeks.  The pack eats breakfast while Mira addresses them about her take on the bigger picture of discretion and the game-changing presence of Nil-Yen-Obscura.  Khonsu devises a plan to exorcise Lexie, and sends Gabe and Michael to get supplies while they prepare to lay the trap.  Khonsu admits that he has never actually PERFORMED the Rite of Summoning before, but he assures the pack he has got the ‘gist of it.’  His explanation tells the pack that he will need them to invest spiritual power into the ritual in order to trick this spirit, whom he believes is obsessed with children, into believing that the doll they offer in the ad hoc ritual is real.  Mira says that there is a gift she wishes to learn from an Ancestor, which she believes would help them capture the spirit.  Khonsu says there is one he wants to know as well, before the rite.  Michael does not agree, saying that this is a waste of time, but Mira and Khonsu depart for the Preserve to learn the Gifts, while the other three go shopping.  At the Mall, Gabriel and Michael gather the supplies while Lexie raids the Apple Store, hacking her account and giving herself enough money for a new laptop, a tablet, and some peripherals.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Saints and Sinners-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='Saints and Sinners' ></A>
Mira and Khonsu summon an Ancestor Spirit through her ability and Saint Kaderi Tagegwitha (Saint Katherine of the Mohawk Tribe) manifests through her.  Mira makes her case and Kaderi tells her that in order to learn the gift Fangs of Judgment, she must seek out, in her human form, a rattlesnake here in the Preserve, catch it bare-handed, and endure its bite for an hour as she makes her way back to this spot.  Only those judged by the fang are worthy to judge the fallen.  After a lengthy and frustrating pursuit, Mira catches the snake, and, feverish and ill, she crawls back to the meeting place.
Meanwhile, Khonsu seeks Owl’s counsel and is granted the Spirit Snare gift.  Victorious, the duo head back to the Motel 8 to meet the others.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Trust Me, I’m A Theurge-</STRONG><BR />
      <A name='Trust Me, I’m A Theurge' ></A>
Back in the motel room, Lexie goes back to bed and the others set the trap, investing Gnosis into the doll, while Khonsu prepares the ritual to trap or track the Dark Passenger.  Gabriel pays the non-English-speaking neighbors some hush money before entering the Umbra alone to lay in wait..  The MacGyvered rite begins, and to the surprise of all present, the Spirit arrives in the Umbra first, oblivious to Michael.  The Spirit looks like a living-in-the-flesh, 7-foot Barbie Doll was given life, two extra arms which end in surgical tools, and no face at all, simply a polished, reflective mirror.  Her skin is faintly cross-hatched with surgical scars from endless tummy tucks, breast enhancements, and more.  Michael attacks as she steps into the Physical world, but she is hard to hurt.  Enamored with the ‘baby’ she lunges for it, and the Pack descends, trying to ignore the horrible visions of themselves she reflects in her mirror.  Defeated, she cries, “I yield!”<BR />

The pack listens as she says that she has hostages in the Umbra.  Children, stolen from the Monroe House just before its destruction, six months ago!  “Narcestua,” as she calls herself, buys her own odd life in exchange for their return.  The Pack follows her back to a tiny Umbral realm, a house within which they walk through empty surgical suites, children’s bedrooms, mostly empty, save for three children, catatonic in beds.  Narcestua takes them through a labyrinth of mirrors and into a basement full of jars containing butterflies, each with a child’s face patterned on their wings.  They open the jars and the children awaken upstairs.  The Pack keeps their word, but forces Narcestua to promise she will never again hunt garou children.  She agrees and the pack leaves the horrid place to return to the motel, and then the Preserve.

Thus burdened with the missing children, who are unharmed other than the whitening of their hair from their long captivity,  the Pack returns to the caern, running into Boots Johnson as he Keeps the Land, and they call Pearl.  Shocked and tearful, she tells the Children of None: “Bring them home.”
